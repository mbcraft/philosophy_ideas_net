A_269 - It is important to understand the concepts of subjectivity, relationship and objectivity. For example, with a stone or a mineral specimen you can close your eyes and feel happy, sad, amused, angry (subjectivity), or you can love, appreciate, despise, insult (relationship) ... or you can lick, paint, sculpt, caress, throw, boil, freeze (interaction) or you can weigh, measure, analyze chemically, describe based on the known sciences (objectivity) ... The concept of objectivity was taught to me by the partner of my previous company (Michele Rispoli).
