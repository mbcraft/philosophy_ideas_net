A_625 - As for disabilities, from what I have observed, they depend on certain factors: either they are caused by accidents, or they are caused by currents of hatred that are poured onto the person or the mother during the growth phase of the fetus in the womb, or they are caused by messes made in the past by other people near or on trees and that should be removed, or they are the price paid when certain messes are removed and certain injustices must be paid. These are broadly speaking, then there may be other cases but they are still more or less attributable to these. In certain cases therefore it is possible that by working with philosophy or even just by removing certain messes that in the future the disabilities at birth may decrease numerically and tend to zero.
