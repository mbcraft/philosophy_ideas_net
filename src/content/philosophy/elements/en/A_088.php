A_088 - I believe that the practice of grafts is simply an extremely serious philosophical mistake, as the natural integrity of a living being is being violated, and that it has then led to very particular consequences on our planet: highly destructive animal species and the transsexuality. I strongly believe that feeling part of oneself of a different sex than one's own is caused by this type of agricultural practice, as I am perfectly aware that what we do to trees affects our psychophysical health. Not only that: as far as I'm concerned, the fruits obtained from that type of tree no longer give me any feeling of being really valid and useful to my body. Personally, I will stop buying and eating fruit from grafted trees whenever possible because I simply consider it a waste of time and money. However, I also want to try to make a useful and constructive criticism, I feel like suggesting a possible solution: if a tree needs another type of plant to function in order to produce fruit with certain characteristics, then I believe that it is sufficient to pollinate those trees with the pollen of the necessary trees. For example, assuming that a pear tree has a chestnut rootstock, then it will most likely be sufficient to pollinate the pear tree with chestnut pollen. Furthermore, if it is too difficult to collect the pollen of certain trees, then it will be sufficient to plant some of these trees in the crops in question (as is already sometimes done in certain crops), so that the pollinating insects then do the pollination part with the flowers they find nearby.
