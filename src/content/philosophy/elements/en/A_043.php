A_043 - I think it could also be interesting to use dinosaur bones to make powdered fertilizer with the same concept illustrated above. After all, it is enough to make a plaster or plastic cast to get an idea of the dimensions inside the museums, there is no real need for the bones to be real. I'm not able to predict what effects it may have on plants, but it would certainly be interesting to experiment with them.
