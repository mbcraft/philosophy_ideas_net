A_328 - For videogame developers, I wanted to suggest that with little you can change the look of many games. By inserting images of the code that alter the colors in the phase after loading, for example, it is possible to change the entire graphic aspect of a game, and the same concept can also be applied to music (for example, raising or lowering octave sound effects or music). So, in a certain sense, just as you can redefine the keys in many games, you can also make alterations to the graphics and sound in a similar way. This can be done for all the graphic and sound elements or even just a part, based on certain rules... Conceptually it can also be done in computer vision objects regarding the visual part... Same concept also regarding the font of the text characters...
