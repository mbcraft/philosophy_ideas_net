A_037 - In my opinion, in an evolved society, garbage management with the recovery of materials must be at the center of people's attention and efforts. This is because when new products and new technologies are created, it is also necessary that the management of the final cycle of the product is managed in the most correct way possible, otherwise the pollution over time ends up destabilizing society.
