A_090 - As for the music to be played by plants, in my opinion it could also be very interesting to make it listen to centenary trees as well. Furthermore, apart from the actual music, in my opinion it could also be very interesting to listen to recordings of very peculiar sounds, such as for example the sound of the wind of mars, the sound of the rings of saturn, or the sound transposition of some physical phenomena of particle collisions recorded at the LHC, or even the sound of a stone falling down a very deep well, just to name a few.
