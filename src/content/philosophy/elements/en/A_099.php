A_099 - Remember when you leave home with your vehicle, to always evaluate your tiredness and the return journey you will have to make in advance. Evaluate how much to eat, avoid alcohol, and if you feel sleepy stop the car, find a parking space and sleep in the car with the 4 flashing lights on, even if only for an hour to recover. Getting home safe and sound should always be the priority.
