A_322 - It is necessary to remember, with regards to sexual intercourse, that their execution in certain cases involves various changes in the psyche of the two participants (male and female) and that in certain cases the psyche deteriorates, and therefore it is necessary (for both) the support of two external people to correct all the mental defects that are created if we do not want the lives of those people to degrade and take a worse direction. To make these corrections you need people with a high IQ and kindness who are responsible for conversing (remotely with chat via computer is probably the best solution but not the only option) in order to correct any defects in the reasoning of the two participants. In general, asking for the support of two external people of the opposite sex for sexual relations is an excellent idea, because potential problems and disasters are avoided. This can be very useful both before, during and after. This can be very useful both before, during and after. Personally I think that, for couples, it is better to do, e.g. 10-20 sexual intercourses of the highest quality in one's life, rather than having more and of very poor quality and completely degrading oneself on a physical and psychological level. At least this is my opinion.
