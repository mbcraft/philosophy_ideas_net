A_609 - As for clothes, I recommend paying attention not only to the quality and materials with which what we wear is made, but also to the label and the name. It seems strange but if there are nomenclatures in certain items of clothing that are problematic, in this case it is better to change brands, or even just paint or use permanent markers to erase what may not be sufficiently correct. In certain cases it is also possible to remove the brand label with the problematic name with scissors.
