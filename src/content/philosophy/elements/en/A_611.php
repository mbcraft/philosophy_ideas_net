A_611 - For those who have to make a journey in the morning to go to work and on the way they know that there are approachable trees, since it is not a crime to fertilize trees, if they have a backpack and a few bottles of natural fertilizer with them, they can take advantage of it if they want. Trees like it if they are fertilized every now and then, and using that journey to leave some fertilizer is definitely a good idea. I point out that even cars that emit fumes from the exhaust pipe stink, but they are so useful that no one questions them much, they are tolerated. Know that the same reasoning also applies to excrement near trees. They are so important that it is really worth covering them with soil, dry leaves or grass clippings and not thinking about them too much.
