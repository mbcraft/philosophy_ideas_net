A_014 - If you are a beekeeper, absolutely remember to make a drinking trough available to your bees especially for the summer season: while in winter bees can quench their thirst with dew, in summer they cannot, and they suffer from thirst. Use mineral water, and if you want add sugar or a small amount of fruit jam, mixing well. Also remember that in winter the hives must always have honey inside because the bees need it to face the cold.
