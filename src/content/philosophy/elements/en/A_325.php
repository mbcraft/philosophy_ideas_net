A_325 - Personally I think it is wiser to leave the truffle to the trees (because I believe they need it) even if we know it tastes good. If it is underground and attached to their roots perhaps it is wiser to leave it there. I believe that it is an excellent idea to try to spread it with the procedure I explained previously but personally I think it is generally wiser to leave it to the trees. In any case, the collection for the purpose of diffusion and fertilization for further diffusion I think is an excellent idea... so in any case I would say that in some way in any case we could favor the sale of the truffle for the purpose of further fertilization, and then that that it was not possible to sell for that type of use, then in that case it can be used for food consumption.
