A_109 - Depending on your sexual habits you reach different situations in life. In the male body there is a sort of &ldquo;channel&rdquo; that starts from the base of the spine which can make a sort of energy flow in two different directions: one direction is the one that leads to ejaculate, the other instead reaches the head. Basically if you ejaculate, the flow towards the head slows down a lot and you are more inclined to ejaculate even more, while instead if you manage to maintain chastity, the flow towards the head tends to increase over time until it reaches its maximum maximum range. The flow to the head helps improve intellectual abilities and increase brain development.
