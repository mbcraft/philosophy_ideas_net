A_484 - When you emigrate from a poor country to a rich one, you would usually do so to study and return to your country of origin or tend to do jobs that people in that country don't want to do. When the opposite happens, it is usually to take positions of power related to government or corporations. Just as it tends to be serious that a person from a poor country socially cheats on people from that nation, it is equally deplorable that people from richer nations are treated with too little attention and consideration. Of course it is also true that since the place is unknown and there are many environmental factors present that it is not always easy to predict, sometimes the situation can get out of hand, but this tends to always lead to unpleasant consequences. This is generally speaking.
