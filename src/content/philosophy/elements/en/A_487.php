A_487 - If you are vegan or fruitarian, ALWAYS avoid, if possible, foods that have flavors similar to those of animal-derived dishes as I have found that when you eat that type of product other people are attracted to buying products with a similar flavour, and therefore tend to it attracts people unaware of the existence of plant-based alternatives to continue consuming animal-derived products. I found this experimentally. I found this experimentally: eating a vegetable food with a flavor similar to tuna for example in a large shopping centre, on the one hand I felt a considerable joy, on the other when I returned home I found dozens and dozens of cans of tuna purchased by my mother exactly on the same day. If possible, make an effort to eat foods that taste different from animal-derived foods; there are myriads of possibilities.
