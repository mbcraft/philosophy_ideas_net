A_346 - I have found that some phenomena, even distant and different from each other, are sometimes mysteriously and inexplicably connected perfectly to each other. This concept essentially applies to the basic concept of &ldquo;information&rdquo;, which can be either something easily observable and measurable, or something mysterious and mystical and which we &ldquo;feel&rdquo; on an internal level. There is already a specific word to define this concept, it is the word &ldquo;synchrony&rdquo;. What happens in some cases is that these information or events &ldquo;hook&rdquo; together, also based on how we behave.
