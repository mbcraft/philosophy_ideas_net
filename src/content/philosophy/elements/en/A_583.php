A_583 - As I also described in a video published on my TikTok profile, I discovered that by maintaining at least a vegan diet (and this certainly also applies to the fruitarian one) and avoiding brushing my teeth, no problems in teeth appeared. And they haven't been brushed with toothpaste for 12 years. Beyond the not very white color of my teeth (a problem that can however be solved), this data is still important to understand that the problem of teeth health is generated by a bad diet and it's not related with sugars. In fact, we know that saliva has enzymes that dissolve sugars, so the hypothesis of blaming sugars is truly a lie. In addition to this, I can also bear witness to a friend who, despite diligently brushing his teeth with a toothbrush and toothpaste several times a day, was still infested with problems in his teeth and suffered terribly from toothaches. Beside that, the Italian word for defining that black painful zone of the teeth is "carie", while the English or American word I found is "cavity" that in some way depicts damage to the teeth structure, and not some kind of infection that shows black spots on the teeth. I don't know why.
