A_615 - It is probable that hunting has negative effects not only on the irrigation systems (which always risk being hit by pellets and being damaged) also due to the fact that the death of animals that graze grass necessarily leads to a worsening of the overall conditions of cultivation in when the more or less random fertilization carried out by such animals ceases. In addition to this, it is probable that their presence also improves the cultivation system itself. It is better to let the foxes think about reducing the excess populations of rabbits and hares, than to worry about going hunting.
