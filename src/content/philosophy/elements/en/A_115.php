A_115 - I think vivisection is a very serious mistake, as is animal testing. We can use artificial intelligence to do complex research and studies, there is no need to harm living beings. In any case, we must remember that if artificial intelligence makes certain professions &ldquo;less useful&rdquo;, we still have a duty to protect the lives of those people and find them suitable work. If you want to use artificial intelligence and the service has negligible costs, I recommend investing $10 in planting trees, possibly in the United States, for every 1.4 uses that are made, in order to avoid future repercussions due to social problems.
