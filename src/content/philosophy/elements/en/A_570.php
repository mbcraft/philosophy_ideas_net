A_570 - Some paints used to paint walls have chemicals inside them that if smelled profoundly alter the psyche, even leading people to think of demons or other amenities. It is good for people to know this and to be very careful because without being psychologically prepared or without the help of a psychologist or support psychologist it may not be easy to manage the side effects of these inhaled chemical substances and be able to free yourself from certain reasoning. Alternatively, going to a spa and breathing in the scents and relaxing could also be very helpful. I therefore suggest that both street artists and those who paint the walls of houses pay particular attention. (Hitler was also a house painter...)
