A_530 - &ldquo;Infosectioning&rdquo; is defined as cutting out and isolating informations to understand whether it is absolutely wrong or not. It can be thought of as a particular way of carrying out discernment. For example, regarding the &ldquo;Roman salute&rdquo; it is considered illegal as it is associated with certain nefarious historical events. However, if you take that concept out of context, and examine it as a &ldquo;greeting&rdquo; itself, what you understand is that its meaning is &ldquo;respect for the leader&rdquo;. However, by slightly altering the context, and assuming for example that there is instead a male leader and a female audience, we understand how the judgment associated with it can easily be distorted. A male audience giving the Roman salute to a female leader, or a female audience giving the Roman salute to a male leader cannot are sample mental contexts that can help people better evaluate that idea. Also using different meaningful context around an information can help people better evaluate it. However, no one is stopping us from using other types of greetings with different meanings. For example, it is quite universally recognized that making a heart with the fingers of both hands to indicate a feeling of love, just as raising the middle finger in the hand is considered an insult and so on.
