A_474 - All people are generally aware that they have had extremely problematic situations and that they would like to talk about to try to resolve and unblock their lives better, but this is not always possible. Being immersed in a particular emotional and psychological context, it sometimes happens that we are aware of something serious but cannot talk about it or cannot find a way to resolve it. It often happens that we can only address SOME of the problems we see and are unable to fix others that we are aware of and which have occurred. Many people (if not all) have hidden problems that they struggle to solve, myself included.
