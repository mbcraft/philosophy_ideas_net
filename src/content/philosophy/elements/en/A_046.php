A_046 - Certain technologies such as wireless signals or touch screens still have an impact on our lives. To give an example, the micro-discharges of the touchscreen screens that pass through the body create very light damage that can accumulate and somatize over time. <br /> It is possible to try to solve this problem by looking with the fingers areas of our body pervaded by pain and massaging them, in case the somatization is in a fairly external area. Personally I have found a point of somatization in the sole of my foot. <br /> As for wireless signals, on the other hand, in some cases they can create sudden distractions as in any case the electromagnetic waves actually interact with our nervous system (which works through electrical signals and therefore is in any case influenced by the presence of electromagnetic waves). <br /> Personally, I can recommend that you keep the wireless or data network on in your smartphone only when you are actively using the phone or actively expecting a response from someone.
