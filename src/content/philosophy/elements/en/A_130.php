A_130 - It can happen that on certain days, for reasons that can be the most disparate, we happen to feel heaviness, malaise, disgust or other unpleasant sensations in our hearts. However, there is a remedy for these difficult moments: by buying some effervescent lemon sweets from a supermarket and keeping a couple of them in your mouth continuously, you can no longer feel those unpleasant sensations and let the day go by much better while waiting for the disgust we feel to pass. ... in any case, sometimes putting up with these unpleasant sensations is also in all respects a job ... even if not at all easy (one rarely likes feeling sad, desperate, grey, etc ...) ... sensations also exist anyway never described before to my knowledge as 'the cold in the heart'. As for me, I have experienced it several times and I find it honestly beautiful and above all useful, as are the seasons. If you think about it, many people enjoy winter sports or snow, so even the cold in my heart honestly pleased me. I also found fun (plenty of it). In any case, practicing meditation has been a great help.
