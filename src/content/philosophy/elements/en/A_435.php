A_435 - Although I don't actually know it... in reality I know that there are people who have perceptions or ideas about how the world around them works that I don't know and can't even imagine... for example, a person with certain scientific knowledge or who has had certain extreme sporting experiences of glacier climbing (just to give two examples) still has a precious experience and his own understanding of the world. In the event that these people share their precious opinions and these are not lost, that experience becomes a &ldquo;brick&rdquo; on which to &ldquo;build&rdquo; something.
