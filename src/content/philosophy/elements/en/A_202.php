A_202 - Sometimes it happens that &ldquo;busty&rdquo; women attract the attention of men. In general it is good to know that, if on the one hand a shapely breast probably guarantees the possibility of producing much more milk for newborns, on the other hand developed breasts weigh down on the woman's spine and very often prevent her from doing sports and certain types of jobs with agility: typically busty women are also much more sedentary. In general, living with these people often also means for men having to endure a certain type of stress (jobs that women cannot do must be done by men) or having to give up a certain type of activity, not to mention that the lack of ability to control one's sexuality in their presence almost always means the end of the relationship. In general, looking at a woman's shapely breasts makes a man happier (due to excitement) and at the same time more dull: for reasons perhaps due to our physiology, men's &ldquo;balls&rdquo; react to the sight of &ldquo;voluminous breasts&rdquo;. of the woman. It is very difficult to live properly with a very curvy woman, it requires a certain type of mental discipline that serves to leave the woman her space and her tranquility. However, it is important to remember that it is equally special and interesting to enjoy the company of women who stand out for their friendliness, their intelligence, to give some examples... (same goes, obviously it applies to what women look for in men...). In any case, some women simply develop when conception occurs.
