A_068 - Know that if you reach some inner goal of value through particular exercises (yoga, meditation, etc...) you may happen to be attacked even in places you consider safe. It happened to me a couple of times and I'm not surprised by this, and in any case it didn't just happen to me ... this is because well-being tends to level off and those who have more, even only internally, are forced to give it to those who are worse off ... it is not easy for those who are worse off to resist certain temptations ...
