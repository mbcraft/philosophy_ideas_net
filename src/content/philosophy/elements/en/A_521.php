A_521 - In life it is possible to react to emotions and sensations in many ways: with rejection, with acceptance... we also know, from experience, that when you meet unknown people of the opposite sex in good health conditions it often happens that there are allusions to sex or sexual interactions of some kind that happen spontaneously and that you don't really know how to behave. A suggestion I can give you is this: for any person of the opposite sex you meet, ALWAYS AND BASICALLY refuse any sexual approach at least for the first 3 months of knowing each other. At least let there be only friendship, disinterested, for at least the first 3 months, because this climate is very useful for making people grow, for them to heal, to understand and get to know each other better, and it is better to reject any predatory instinct that may arise, because people, all of them, need to make their own assessments, not to be scared and not be treated like prey. Unlike what happens in nature, in which animals sometimes barely meet a partner, and in any case there is always a courtship phase, since we are generally quite dense in cities, to foster friendships it is essential to maintain this approach: first always and only the friendship, obligatorily, for at least 3 months. Then, generally, if the healthier person decides to carry the slightly shabbier one on his shoulders even in the long term, then you can think about starting a family together... <br />
Note: in case you can't control yourself, if even for just a second you can remember to punch the wall, it's definitely much much better than attacking the other person, and you can't imagine how much respect you will gain for not ruining his or her life ... It's much better to endure a little pain than to sexually assault someone...
