A_411 - Sometimes emails considered spam for reasons that are difficult to understand still contain advertising information or links that can still be useful to our profession or our personal life. I recommend not throwing them away unless you have a more or less in-depth look at them. However, most email programs also allow you to use folders to archive mail and divide it according to our preferences.
