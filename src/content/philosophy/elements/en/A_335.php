A_335 - For street artists who want to paint graffiti, I personally recommend carrying out an analysis and planning of what they want to create before making them. Personally, the type of art I prefer is high-quality abstract art, even made with algorithms, because I believe it is also the most long-lived and generally appreciated. It is also possible to purchase it online, print it on paper and then use the printed reference as a guide. I believe improvised art, conceptually, is nothing more than a sort of &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; of the situation perceived by the artist. Furthermore, if paints that transform smog into salt are used, perhaps, in some way, it could also be possible to collect it and use it for food purposes... it must also be said, in any case, that the presence of graffiti on walls of buildings or houses create effects both on those who look at them from the outside and on those who use those buildings... so know that if you also want to earn money in some way, you can potentially ask for money both from those who use that building and also from the public administration of that city...
