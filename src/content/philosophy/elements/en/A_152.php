A_152 - In general, religions, as well as this web page, are simple &ldquo;philosophy boxes&rdquo;. The most famous religions in the world are in some cases built from scratch, in other cases they are built on the mistakes of other religions. I'll give some examples: Taoism was born from a humble old man who was threatened to make him write what he knew. In the Catholic religion, God is represented as a bearded old man and it is no coincidence that he is considered omnipotent. Another example: Buddha said that when you love a flower you pick it, but this was his mistake. The Catholic religion later invented the bells, which were nothing more than an indication that &ldquo;the problem of the flowers had to be resolved&rdquo; (the bells represent the dead flower, they have the shape of the upside-down flower). Unfortunately those bells have been rung and many birds have been harassed for many years. It is no coincidence that Christopher Columbus discovered America (Christ-drill-Columbus in italian is an indication: it means that the Catholic religion was bothering the birds with the usage of bells). Islam is also built on the errors of the Catholic religion. Since &ldquo;god&rdquo; has always been represented as man, and women objectified in the tenth commandment, the god of Islam is It has been called Allah (All-ah), and it is simply a ploy to save female sexuality. The name &ldquo;Islam&rdquo; can be read as &ldquo;I-slam&rdquo; (to be read in English), and it is no coincidence that there is a nation called &ldquo;Saudi Arabia&rdquo;: it recalls &ldquo;Anger is fulfilled&rdquo; (in italian). In some cases the major religions also preserve discoveries that are not revealed to the masses, not necessarily out of malice.
