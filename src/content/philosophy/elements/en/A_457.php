A_457 - Personally, I advise against smoking non-electronic cigarettes in a heavy manner, but I advise non-smokers to meet up with friends once in a while, buy a pack of cigarettes and smoke it in company (if you live in places where there is no smog pollution). In the desert I think it's better not to smoke, even if you're a smoker.
