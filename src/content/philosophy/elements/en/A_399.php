A_399 - I strongly suggest that astronauts but also people who live in places with too few trees NOT to play video games as sometimes even fertilized trees are needed as support. In any case, there are also games in the form of objects (eg. Rubik cube, labirinths, games on paper ...) that can be used for entertainment and which do not require too much support from important vegetation (maybe).
