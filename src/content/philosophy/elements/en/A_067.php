A_067 - The use of names of pure fantasy or in any case with a meaning associated with existing words that have to do with what the company does (e.g. MBCRAFT?, FINCONS, WEBUILD) represents a better choice than names associated with words already existing ones that have nothing to do with what the company does as this approach helps reduce mental clutter and create better mental spaces. Personally, in the past I had thought about changing the name and logo of my company, but at the moment I haven't allowed myself yet.
