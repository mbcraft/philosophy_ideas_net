A_564 - Unfortunately, the Catholic Church, by representing God as a bearded old man and leaving prayers aside, has in fact caused older men to die prematurely compared to older women. Statistics and science say so, and the explanation why this happens is exactly this. So, we know that prayers have concrete effects and it is scientifically proven (also thanks to Masaru Emoto), but asking for resources from a generic bearded old man is not at all kind.
