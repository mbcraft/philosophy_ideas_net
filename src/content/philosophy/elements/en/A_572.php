A_572 - In snow-covered woods, where it has snowed and the snow has accumulated on the trees, it would be important to somehow manage to get the snow to fall to the ground by removing it from the branches as in this way the sunlight is able to reach the leaves better (for how small or needle-like) and the branches do not risk breaking due to the continuous weight on them. This serves to take a lot of effort away from the tree and help it receive sunlight better.
