A_132 - If you want to vent because you are frustrated for some reason, remember that it is also possible to get angry at a wall: even if it may seem a little silly, in reality it is not at all. When you get angry with people it always creates bad moods and sadness, which must then always be &ldquo;reabsorbed&rdquo; by those who have been hurt.
