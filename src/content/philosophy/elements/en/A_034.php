A_034 - Plants love the excrement of animals and people just as people and animals love fruit from trees. If you live in the countryside or near woods, if you have the opportunity to urinate near trees or defecate near trees covering everything with leaves, soil or grass clippings instead of lazily using the toilet, know that nature will probably reward you for your efforts as soon as you go to bed, or with tastier fruits, or with larger vegetables, etc... <br />
If you live in countries that tend to be freezing or snowy, you can put the excrement in a large airtight container and take it into the woods where there are trees. It's much better than having them end up in the sea through the sewer system.<br /> However, if there is a lot of moisture in the soil then it is better to use the toilet and let the drains work. <br />
Depending on what you eat, the shit changes its smell. If you eat meat, it has a nauseating smell, which does not happen with a plant-based nutrition. <br />
This is due to the rot bacteria that form in the stomach when eating meat or fish. These bacteria also have consequences on psychological aspects: the flora bacteria that we have in the stomach affects the way we think.<br />
Personally, changing my nutrition required a lot of mental discipline. If you have too many difficulties ask for help (nutritionists, psychologists, philosophers, etc ...) <br />
One more thing about your excrements: if you can even taste them when you have a few days off, know that they cause a slight mental confusion for 1-2 days, but then increase your understanding of your surroundings in a decisive way. I understand that it sucks, but if you can tolerate it there are significant benefits. For those who live in the countryside, in any case I advise you not to snub urinating near small plants such as nettles or other &ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo; plants. As regards the management of city sewerage, instead of sending the waste into the sea, an idea could be to stop the pipes towards the sea and use drains when necessary to collect the excrement and use it not only for crops, but also to fertilize the forests ...
