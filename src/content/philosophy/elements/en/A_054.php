A_054 - Furthermore, always with regard to love, I have noticed that in a situation for example I was extremely sincere (because I was in love) but the other person reacted by getting angry at what I was saying, or by saying absolutely meaningless things even though to put the other person at ease and not to contradict them (because being in love, the aim was to put them at ease). So anyway it's interesting to note, in the second case I mentioned, that being in love I wasn't able to REALLY help the other person with really useful advice, but only to &ldquo;make them relax&rdquo; in their comfort zone. When you are in love it is very difficult to contradict the other person.
