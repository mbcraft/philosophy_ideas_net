A_208 - For those who own it, it is best to turn off the smartphone before going to bed and turn it back on in the morning. Some people think they have to keep it on to make themselves available in case of problems with friends or family, but since there are police, emergency services and firefighters it is better for people to resort to those services in case of serious problems during the night.
