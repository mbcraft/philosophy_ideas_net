A_272 - It is clear that the phenomena of &ldquo;peoplefield&rdquo; and &ldquo;gaslighting&rdquo; can also occur simultaneously and that the presence of these combined phenomena creates very particular situations. However, you can escape from the &ldquo;peoplefield&rdquo; by going elsewhere physically (for example, trekking) while it is difficult to escape from &ldquo;gaslighting&rdquo; because at the moment there are no mechanisms to block all the online elements strictly connected to the person who is being &ldquo;gaslighted&rdquo;. (I am talking about all the various social networks and other portals with profiles connected to that person)
