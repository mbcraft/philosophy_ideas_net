A_268 - If you don't need it in home routers that allow you to use the internet connection only via wireless waves and which in any case have &ldquo;2.4 G&rdquo; and &ldquo;5 G&rdquo; connections, I recommend disabling the &ldquo;5 G&rdquo; frequency (for routers that have this option) and to use only the &ldquo;2.4 G&rdquo; one.
