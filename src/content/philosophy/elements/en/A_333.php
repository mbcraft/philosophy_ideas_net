A_333 - Every person has an emotionality that is developed as a series of concentric spheres, where in the center there is the most intimate, precious, mysterious and reserved part and in the most external part there is the most public and shared part. The more tired we are, the more our psychological defenses lower and we run the risk that the most internal and precious parts could be violated. The more internal the damaged or violated emotional part is, the more difficult and complicated it is to regenerate from that damage and recover that part completely. The number of emotional layers that people have is not the same for everyone, but in any case, the more they have, the happier they can be.
