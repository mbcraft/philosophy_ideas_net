A_406 - Even if I don't know how it's possible, I want to point out that in the room I use as an office I found insects (both bedbugs and wasps) that I don't have the faintest idea of how they got in. I always keep both the door and window closed, and despite everything I often find bedbugs and I even happened to find some wasps (4 or 5). I'm not talking about 4 or 5 bedbugs, but several dozen (I constantly put them outside the window). How this is possible remains a mystery ... they almost seem to appear like what happens with certain creatures in video games ... even if I have several potted plants, I don't understand how they can (if this were the eventuality) be born, nourish themselves, grow and appear only when they are perfectly adults ...
