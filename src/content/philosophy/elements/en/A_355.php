A_355 - I learned from my mother that, if you want to reheat pasta from the day before which may have been stored in the refrigerator, if you cook other pasta you can use the cooking water to reheat the unseasoned cold pasta stored in the refrigerator. However, I recommend avoiding pasta as a food, as it becomes quite sticky in the stomach and doesn't provide significant nutrients. It's better to opt for rice if you're looking for something similar, or even cooked beans from a can.
