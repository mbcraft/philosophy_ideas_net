C_006 - There is a battery technology called "magnesium-air". They are batteries approximately 5 times more powerful than lithium ones. Since they work on magnesium+salt water+activated carbon... if it couldn't be interesting to use it for container ships that use petroleum fuels which are currently super-polluting. After all, magnesium is obtained from sea water, there is already salt water in the sea, and as regards activated carbon, I believe that this is also a material that is extremely inexpensive to produce... it seems like a potentially interesting idea... I posted this concept on Facebook on November 5, 2022...
