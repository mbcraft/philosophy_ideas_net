A_434 - We often hear that Italy is a secular state. Well actually this is not true since in any case all government laws are always written using philosophical or scientific information as a basis for example. For example, many laws are built around the 10 commandments of the Catholic Church to protect private property or the right to health. If, however, from scientific analyzes and experiments we find that some substances are dangerous because we are unable to use them as food without going crazy, then the laws on drugs appear, etc... obviously the interest of a nation is always the protection of the community and harmonious coexistence. For example, nations with a desert climate or with extremely cold temperatures, or nations within islands obviously also have concepts that concern what I have just described, and therefore in certain cases they have ad hoc laws always to protect people's lives as placed within particular circumstances. In any case, it is important to note that certain objects or inventions always have experiences around them that cannot be known a priori and in general it is always better to keep an eye open to ensure that certain innovations do not have unwanted effects that are too problematic for certain categories of individuals. In addition to this, at the moment the laws of nations are broadly listed in numerical order, but this does not mean that they cannot, for example, be structured into hierarchical groups, or into lists divided into categories (and which in certain cases can also include light changes or even repetitions if necessary).
