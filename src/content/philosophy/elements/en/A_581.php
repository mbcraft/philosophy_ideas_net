A_581 - If we feel frustrated it can be useful, when we walk or do some daily gestures at home, to be a little scenic. By "scenic" I mean moving hands or feet in unusual ways that do not represent the shortest path to perform a gesture. This serves to protect your psyche as those gestures that you invent alone in your homes are known only to you and they serve to help you regain the psychological space that can been lost due to other issues.
