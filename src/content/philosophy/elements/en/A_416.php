A_416 - From what I have been able to observe, trees try to grow, even developing in an unusual way in order to find the spaces they need. This brings us back to the great dilemma of the rows and how to manage, in some way, to reduce the cuts of the branches that prevent the passage of agricultural vehicles. As far as I'm concerned it's still a problem without an optimal solution. However, I have recently also noticed trees and plants growing with new algorithms (in the growth of branches or leaves), so it is not certain that in the near future we will not be able to solve this problem (if that can be solved) in some way.
