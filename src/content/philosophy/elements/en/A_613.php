A_613 - "Faith", the concept expressed many times in the Catholic religion, is the ability to trust the future. However, it depends on an important factor, namely the health of the vegetation as well as that of the surrounding people. People who manage to have "faith" very often have the ability to perceive something that supports and guides them in their life. This particular "aura" (which not everyone feels or which some feel only for brief moments) depends largely on the health of the population and the health of the vegetation. In my life I have perceived it for about 5-6 seconds with strong intensity and I managed to identify it and explain a lot about this concept, which was previously obscure to me. However, since we are all interconnected, faith simply works even without these exceptional perceptions (because in any case it is important to remember that even having certain sensations has costs for nature and for people) if we are within a certain context. In addition to this, it must be said that the result and timing of interaction can vary greatly depending on the context. Faith works because we have mental faculties that are in some way interconnected to the actions of other people we know, but also thanks to the health of vegetation.
