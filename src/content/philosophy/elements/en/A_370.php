A_370 - I can confirm, both in terms of my direct personal observations and information from stories learned via the internet, that reincarnation, indeed, in some way, is a phenomenon that seems to occur. We know little or nothing about consciousness, and even if it is not pleasant to face death, it is still comforting that in some way nature manages to &ldquo;recycle&rdquo; us, in some way... If we consider the following concepts, and make connections between them, we can notice that there are &ldquo;circular&rdquo; flows and that we are interdependent: the ground [1], the trees [2], the fruits of the trees [3], the processed wood [4], the people and their interactions with wooden objects [5], the CO2 from burnt wood and the air we breathe [6], our excrement [7], the remains of the deceased [8]. In any case, it is important to know that caring about the dead is important and that, paradoxically, we as people cannot help any dead person (except through burial), but only dead beings of other species.
