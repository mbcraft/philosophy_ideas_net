A_036 - Personally I also believe that in many cases plastic can replace wood as a building material: it is resistant to mold, termites, can be of various colors and does not cause the death of trees (and recycled plastics can also be used). Naturally, plastics that have the same workability characteristics as wood would be needed so that they can be used with the same tools that already exist.
