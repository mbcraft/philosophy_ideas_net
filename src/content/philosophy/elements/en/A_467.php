A_467 - I think it is quite obvious that in the areas closest to the polar ice caps it is reasonably much easier to operate large metallurgical foundries, while it is very difficult if not impossible in the equatorial areas. For example, it is quite reasonable that a nation like Russia can manage foundries effectively, just as it is equally obvious that it cannot easily deal with agricultural crops. In general, it is better to exploit the strengths of the territories to develop quality companies and rely on foreign nations for what you cannot do, without arguing.
