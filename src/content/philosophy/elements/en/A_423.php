A_423 - Sex without consent is rape. Generally people don't like to be broken or preyed upon. In any case, if situations arise in which a person makes you angry, rather than physically attacking he or she, punch the wall or the floor instead: it is better to hurt yourself, humiliate yourself and wear out the romantic relationship and/or of friendship in this way if you want to intelligently make the other person understand that their behavior is somehow wrong. When a person makes us lose our patience, generally, he or she demands something from us that is impossible or too problematic for us and he or she doesn't understand it. In any case we always have the choice to wear out the relationship or relationship and make it less important. Getting angry is the sum of two factors : I'm in love with you or I'm your friend and (for example) you're asking me to do something impossible. It is an emotional failure, and when I use the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; I mean it in an economic sense, of resources no longer sufficient to allow friendship and/or love to coexist and at the same time the request made of us. It can help us understand, for example, that if an unknown person gives us a fruit to eat when we are hungry and have no money available, that anger in that case cannot actually exist. In any case, this is just an example of a type of anger, there are others too, but usually it is always two opposites colliding and you do not have sufficient resources to resolve the situation or the context does not allow it.
