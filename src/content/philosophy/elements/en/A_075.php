A_075 - In certain online sites or paper brochures I have come across information that is misleading or so confusing as to be even dangerous for my mental health. Always be especially careful when reading foreign language content online. In case of extremely confused concepts and with words that have little to do with each other, one runs the risk of losing mental health. Once I even bought a book in a foreign language which was supposed to be of university level and I found so many errors and inaccuracies in it that I decided to burn it in the cauldron, while in another case, always with a book in a foreign language, I I found a book done so well that it helped me a lot in the job I had to do.
