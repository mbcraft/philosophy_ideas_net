A_240 - Personally I am not a fan of tattoos or circumcisions or some other permanent operations on the body, but these are personal (sometimes) choices that I do not discuss. If you like to be photographed with drawings on your body, body painting is much smarter because it still allows you to be painted in many different ways at a later time. Just as people get tattoos and live their daily lives, there is nothing to stop them from getting body paint done before a sports competition or fashion show.
