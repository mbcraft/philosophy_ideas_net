A_477 - If you do not have a very high IQ (due to your life choices that no one questions) and a certain type of environment where there are no distractions and you are basically very used to that place, I strongly advise you not to experiment: it could be dangerous and you may not be able to understand the actual outcome of what you are experiencing. Certain experiments are better done only in laboratories or in some working environments, and only if they are ethical.
