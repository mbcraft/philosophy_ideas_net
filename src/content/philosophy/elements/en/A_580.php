A_580 - In summer or in any case when it's hot it can be useful to walk barefoot on the floor, to have a little coolness on your feet, even if you get a little dirty. It is useful on a psychological level to have a difference in temperature with respect to the head for example, to think better. If we have a tiled floor that is sufficiently clean, after having refreshed our feet a bit with a quick rinse and drying we can put our shoes back on without getting them dirty.
