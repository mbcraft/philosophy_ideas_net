A_592 - When you buy bread, it is common to store it in a paper bag, often in a cupboard. If you put the paper bag in a closed plastic bag, then the bread does not dry out because the humidity does not disperse and it remains soft for longer. Furthermore, this advice can also be used by bars, bakers and pastry chefs at the end of the working day, to better preserve their products while waiting for the next working day.
