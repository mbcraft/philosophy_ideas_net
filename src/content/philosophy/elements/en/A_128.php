A_128 - Many people in some markets are used to haggling over the price. In general, if you bargain on the price, it means that you think the merchant is cheating you, unless it's a real auction. Remember that in any case if he set a price, he did it by making his reasoning about him. If you try to undercut a product that's already cheap, you could sow resentment. However, if you have economic problems and want to negotiate a better price, at least try to leave the merchant information that can be useful to him, in order to give him the total value he requires for that particular product or service.
