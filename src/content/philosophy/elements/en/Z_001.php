Z_001 - Anyone who wants to work so as to make it widely disseminated, if he wants to be successful, is better off:
<ul>
	<li>Maintain chastity for a long time and have no dependent children</li>
	<li>Have had a completely plant-based diet for a few years</li>
	<li>Do not use artificial intelligence, but rely only on your perceptions and observations to make your reasoning</li>
	<li>Has no significant physical defects, as they alter the psyche and therefore also the way of processing concepts</li>
	<li>If possible, live in somewhat isolated, quiet places with sufficient vegetation around</li>
	<li>Have the opportunity to access information sources of some kind: newspapers, television, radio or the internet, whatever they may be</li>
	<li>Has been resident in that place for at least 4-5 years</li>
	<li>Make sure you dedicate enough time to it</li>
	<li>Share what you discover and what is useful to the community in a way that allows multiplication of what is discovered</li>
	<li>Have at least one person of the opposite sex supporting you from afar</li>
	<li>Has access to food and some economic resources in some way (earned with other types of jobs)</li>
	<li>Have a good basic culture</li>
	<li>Be in a place with sufficient presence of trees</li>
	<li>Be friendly and hardworking</li>
</ul>

This is the way I think is best to minimize risk and achieve the best possible impact.
