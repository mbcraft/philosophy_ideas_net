A_278 - I define a &ldquo;psychological event&rdquo; as an event that occurs only in the mind (and which does not seem to be justifiable or explainable by anything externally observable or audible in our vicinity) and whose origin can hardly be predicted or explained. They are psychological events, for example sounds, images or even sudden sensations that we perceive mentally, to which we eventually psychologically associate judgments of good, neutral or bad for our personal or even professional life.
