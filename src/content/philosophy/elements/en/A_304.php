A_304 - In general, rather than trying to carry out projects while trying to save as much as possible on the budget, it is better to give up on doing a project entirely rather than try to carry it out on a tight budget. If you can't pay workers and necessary resources what they're worth, give up on certain projects. It's a much wiser choice.
