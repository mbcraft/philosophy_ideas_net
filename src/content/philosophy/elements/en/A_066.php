A_066 - It's important to commit to carefully choosing the words of our thoughts and speeches because paying a little more attention and effort can be beneficial. For example it is better to ask &ldquo;How much does it cost?&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo;. (The second example i put in the italian version of this periods are not actually translatable to English/American - sorry). This is because in the first case the word &ldquo;cost&rdquo; unequivocally refers or is more near to the concept of &ldquo;price&rdquo;, while the words &ldquo;is it&rdquo; are used with other many different meanings. (Explanation of second example skipped). Using words with more specific and unique meanings reduces confusion, misunderstandings and helps maintain clearer and stronger intentions. This is an example of what I call &ldquo;mental discipline&rdquo;.
