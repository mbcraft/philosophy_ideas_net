A_205 - When companies collaborate with each other in a customer-supplier relationship, it can be useful to dedicate a few hours to socializing between the various people involved in the project: while on the one hand it is true that it is necessary to respect certain protocols to ensure that all the work carried out is actually counted and paid and that the work carried out respects certain quality parameters, on the other hand it is not clear why human relationships cannot still be created which can probably help both parties to work much better. The fact that there are very specific roles for working correctly in a certain way does NOT mean that you shouldn't be able to get to know each other or make friends.
