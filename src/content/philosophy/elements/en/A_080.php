A_080 - If you use post-its, I'll reveal some useful concepts. The first is to use a pencil to write instead of ballpoint pens as you don't risk them jamming and you don't risk getting stained with the ink. In this way you can also keep them resting on the table and use both front and back without staining the table. Furthermore, when using post-it notes to keep notes like todo-lists, the important thing is to keep in mind the concept of &ldquo;carpe diem&rdquo;: when something comes to your mind, even if you're away from your desk or doing something else , interrupt your activity and write yourself a note on the post-it. This way you will be able to make the most of them. At that point when you work with your desk you will have all the todo-lists as a reminder and you will be able to work more effectively without scattering good ideas. They are very convenient to use even when you are away from home and you don't want to lose some idea or consideration that comes to mind.
