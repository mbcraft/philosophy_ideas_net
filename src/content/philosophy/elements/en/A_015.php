A_015 - In some cases, some diseases such as Xylella for olive trees or stress for cork trees lead to serious problems for the tree, sometimes even causing its death. To overcome these problems, instead of resorting to grafts as is done with Xylella, it is better to resort to fertilization. It is in fact scientifically proven that some fertilizations cure plant diseases, therefore we only need to experiment with them until we find the correct one. I think this line of research is very interesting to explore, and I have noticed progress in this regard. As an example, I list some 'things' that are actually fertilizer for plants: solid and liquid excrements, coffee grounds, sand, milk, paprika, NPK chemical fertilizer, bones, teeth, volcanic lapilli, ash, truffles, beard and hair , nails, blood, tumor masses, liposuction grease, fish found dead stranded. Many of these fertilizers require to be transformed into a liquid solution by grinding or blending and mixed with the right amount of water. I also think it might also be interesting to experiment with the arsenic-based bacteria found in some arsenic pools as they are actually non-carbon based living things. As for the truffle, probably by grinding it and mixing it with water and pouring it near the roots we can effectively propagate it. In any case I don't know if the truffle is considered invasive by the plant or if it is a &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; organism. Personally I think it would be smart to propagate truffles in this way also and above all near secular trees, possibly trying not to remove them later (at least from those). To the list of fertilizing substances I add two others that could be experimented, even if with some reservations: honey and sperm. Furthermore, in my opinion, ground wood and whole or rotten fruit are NOT to be considered as fertilizer.
