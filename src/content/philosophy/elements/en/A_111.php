A_111 - In offices it is important to work in adequate spaces. If there are people talking nearby, other people who are forced to listen are forced to concentrate more in order not to make a mistake, and sometimes even concentrating is not enough. Furthermore, we tend to influence each other even on a mental level. The only advantage of working in offices, in my opinion, is more on an emotional level. People who are worse off can have a little chat with those who are better off and this helps them feel better emotionally. The other side of the coin, however, is that determinism is lost. Just to help you think, we can take as an example the &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; operating system (made by a company with huge offices) and the Linux operating system (made mainly by volunteers distributed all over the planet). They are two polar opposite development models: on the one hand, the Windows operating system supports many more games and programs, on the other, the Linux operating system is known for its speed, robustness and security, but supports fewer games and applications. They are precisely the result of two different development models.
