A_618 - Just as with running, it is possible to accelerate and decelerate, and the jumps that can be made also change based on the speed, the same concept also applies to our mind. What I try to explain is that if we are demoralized and "switched off" it is as if we were standing still, whereas if we get excited and encouraged towards a goal, then in that case it is very likely that we can achieve it better, in our free time . Clearly, if a task is obligatory, this discussion doesn't make much sense, but for something totally optional we can also try to self-motivate and self-encourage, as if we were the audience of a stadium, and start towards what we have to achieve to try to conclude it. It is a method that works, because our mind also has mechanisms that also work thanks to emotions, therefore if we are able to associate positive emotions with a task, this is made easier. Paradoxically, we can also create emotions ourselves, like when you cheer at a stadium, and it works. But if we want we can also read inspiring stories or talk to someone who can inspire us... they are all mechanisms that work. What perhaps was known to few is that we can also inspire ourselves, just as we take the leap to jump a ditch on our own, in the same way we can also do it for some demanding tasks that we have to carry out. Naturally without going overboard: one might think of being a bit of an athlete, but not a superhero with who knows what powers.
