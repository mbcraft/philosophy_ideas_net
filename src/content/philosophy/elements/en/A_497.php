A_497 - It is important to know, beyond the ecological movements, that bottled water is always of higher quality than filtered tap water. Therefore, if you are very stressed or have to work with great precision or more intelligently, I recommend absolutely using bottled water, or always purchasing a few bottles, even just to be able to have a psychological comparison between the different types of water you use.
