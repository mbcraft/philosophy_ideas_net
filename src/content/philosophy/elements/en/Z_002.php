Z_002 - Regarding what was written in the previous element, I would like to clarify: that is my vision. But there are some clarifications to make. People with disabilities often have very valuable qualities and they allow them to do jobs that are impossible for most other people, and precisely because they are not possible they have a much higher value. But what happens, however, is that very often their value is not rightly repaid by the community, and this leads to very serious consequences. Respecting disabled people MORE would lead to fewer disasters in the world. The reason why, in philosophy, I believe that it is better if there are no disabled people to deal with it, is because the lack of respect, in that case, could lead to even more serious consequences, and because, in any case, the use of those philosophies would still lead people towards that condition of disability. In addition to this, I am aware that, in reality, being a computer scientist and having used a sort of AI for translations, my perception is altered by this choice. And in fact, not surprisingly, I wrote that it is better not to use AI for the creation of basic philosophy. A person who trains daily with physical exercises and without using IT tools would most likely have considerations that I cannot imagine, and they would still have great value. I want to give some examples: Stephen Hawking created documentaries of great value, and scientific considerations of great value, but the community did not show enough respect for his immense intelligence, and because of this, there were tragic consequences. The same is very likely to have happened or is happening to other people with disabilities. Next time a disabled person similar to &ldquo;Hawking&rdquo; creates something of such great value, it's better we make sure the people who live in &ldquo;L'Aquila&rdquo; know about it, and that people far from &ldquo;L'Aquila&rdquo; observe the news regarding the city to understand if there are serious anomalies.
