A_598 - As regards acupuncture, I would suggest that those who can provide these therapies consider the following reflection: if needles are used that pierce the skin, at that point it may also make sense to dip the needles in substances useful to the body so that the sting, in addition to causing pain, also serves to absorb some type of vegetable/mineral mixture. Having said this, since acupuncture is based on the concept of pain applied in certain parts of the body, it is not even said that it cannot be practiced with sharp objects with a suction cup attachment but which are not needles, with the sole purpose of causing a mild pain without piercing the skin. This could also serve to find many new clients, as many don't try acupuncture just because they don't want to have their skin pierced. However, the possibility of using these two alternatives would not be bad.
