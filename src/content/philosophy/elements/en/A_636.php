A_636 - A few days ago I was wondering what love is, how to define it. Many people have talked about it, poets, philosophers, writers and artists of all types and genres. I wanted to share my vision. As far as I'm concerned, it's not so important to understand what love is more than "a very pleasant sensation", but rather to understand where it comes from and how to obtain it honestly. The answer I found is this: just as a slingshot, to throw a stone in one direction, must be stretched and pulled in the opposite direction, the same goes for love. It is only by learning to work hard, to endure the effort and, if you want, even a little suffering, and by cultivating one's intelligence, that we can lay the necessary foundations so that love can spring forth. What matters, in the end, in couples, is precisely being able to collaborate as much and as well as possible. And collaborating, as the word itself says, means working together "in concert". I can understand that this definition may seem a bit rustic and rough, but I'm not interested in pleasing others in what I say, but only in saying what I think.
