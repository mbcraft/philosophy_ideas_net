A_496 - For those who make large investments of money, it is important to keep track of the progress of completed projects. Regardless of whether the project for which money was invested was successful or not (not all projects are successful and sometimes there are unforeseen events)... it is important that whoever invested the money has at least an account of the activities carried out. In any case, it is important that those who invest money also know that there is a social component that has a cost and that people are not robots and that a percentage of the money invested must also be allocated for the personal purposes of those working on the project: this increases the chances of success drastically.
