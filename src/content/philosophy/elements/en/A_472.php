A_472 - Regarding the concept of &ldquo;carpe diem&rdquo;, we can think that it could be useful to us in the event that, at certain times, we have to make decisions (such as when we have to get on public transport). As far as personal life is concerned, however, I believe that it is intolerable to think that we have to decide within a few seconds by trusting some sensation (provided it is reliable) whether to go to a place or not to find a partner, but that instead an occasion in which there is also time to chat to get to know each other even by meeting.
