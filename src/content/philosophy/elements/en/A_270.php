A_270 - What I define as &ldquo;peoplefield&rdquo; is the psychological phenomenon that occurs when in the presence of certain people nearby you think certain thoughts, which you would not think without the nearby presence of those people. The presence of this &ldquo;peoplefield&rdquo; creates a psychological environment in which certain thoughts are easier and others are more difficult if not impossible.
