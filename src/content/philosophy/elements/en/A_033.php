A_033 - As for pets, adopting a pet from a kennel or cattery for example is not just a gesture of kindness. I have experienced on myself that the presence of a pet in the same room I am in allows me to do actions and reasoning that otherwise I would not be able to do. So even if keeping an animal comes with a small expense, there are still both emotional and practical benefits if they are treated properly.
