A_539 - As for nosebleeds stopped with cotton wool and vaginal swabs, once the usage is finished, instead of throwing them away, you can squeeze them into a half glass of water (mineral or filtered) to use as fertilizer for plants or trees. If you use toilet paper made from bamboo to make nose swabs, it is particularly water-soluble. In addition to this, however, if when your nose bleeds you take a glass directly into your hand and collect the blood by mixing it with a little water, perhaps you can give it to the potted plants sooner.
