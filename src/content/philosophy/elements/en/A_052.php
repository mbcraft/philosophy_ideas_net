A_052 - As for love with the opposite sex, I have had love experiences that have &ldquo;turned on&rdquo; simply by persevering in kindness with the other sex. Sometimes even without ever meeting physically, but only using IT communication tools. There are probably different types of love based on the combination of people that is formed, because I have experienced at least 10 different ones (for example one seemed to me more a sort of &ldquo;strawberry&rdquo; love while another was more a kind of love &ldquo;bright aquatic&rdquo;, many of them lasted just a couple of seconds). This is also why I believe that kindness is important in our society. I also happened to fall in love with a person who was already in love with another person. In that case I preferred to let the love go out, as the other person had communicated to me that he wanted to marry that other person. Sometimes it can also happen that when you are in love with a person who gets married to someone else, our heart goes to pieces for a moment, but then over time everything is sorted out ... <br />
Moreover, if you happen to fall in love and completely lose the ability to reason, pour your love into gestures of kindness towards the trees, or if there are none, of those who happen to be within your reach, perhaps with a hug. In that way you will be able to regain the ability; to reason.
I also had a long-distance relationship where instead of love I felt hate. In that case it still served me perhaps to clean up the other person and somehow spurred me to squeeze more.
