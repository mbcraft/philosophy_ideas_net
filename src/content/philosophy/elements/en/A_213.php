A_213 - Conceptually, even home ADSL modems/routers could be turned off at night when they are not actively used via the appropriate on/off button. In addition to saving electricity, it would also be a way to reduce electromagnetic pollution. Not much relative to a single family, but if a million people did it the impact would be non-negligible. If we also take into account the electricity saved by all the routers involved in the network, the energy saving and increase in the life of the equipment would produce savings that are anything but negligible.
