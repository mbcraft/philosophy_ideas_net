A_556 - Personally, I advise anyone against procreating when they are not pregnant. in good health condition. Having some damaged parts of the body (broken bones, internal organs with chronic problems) can lead to problems in offspring. In particular, the integrity of the bones is important to be able to use IT tools or make certain assessments without making errors. Otherwise, when possible, the only solution is to recheck 2 or 3 times what you have typed the text in order to remove all the inevitable errors that will be present. In addition to this, I advise against using the computer in general when you have health problems, as it could lead to the propagation of errors or problems both on the internet, in the surrounding environment or in what you're producing with the computer.
