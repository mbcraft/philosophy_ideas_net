A_523 - Rights (such as privacy or other rights), in certain cases, are not guaranteed &ldquo;in themselves&rdquo; but only by the possession of certain objects or economic resources. Health conditions also influence the right: a person with a broken bone or abrasions, being more psychologically fragile, is also more vulnerable in certain situations. To give another example, in certain cases the right is guaranteed by works previously carried out by certain companies. For example, we have water that we can use comfortably in our homes because aqueducts have been built, and we can take a hot shower because boilers have been invented, etc... in the final analysis we can say that honest and honestly paid work and managed creates a right, and that once the infrastructure to provide it is built the cost of providing that right typically becomes very low. A hot shower, clothes washed in a washing machine or a phone call are, in a certain sense, rights or privileges that we can enjoy thanks to work previously carried out. In the same way, it is important to point out that discipline must follow hand in hand with law, because if it is absent there is a risk that law will be undermined and extremely unpleasant events may occur. Note: the quality and health of the surrounding vegetation is an element that can never be overlooked. Furthermore, due to the phenomenon I described as &ldquo;error closing&rdquo;, in fact any job or technology ALWAYS has hidden and unknown problems that are inevitable and manifest themselves over time. For example, washing machines, when washing synthetic clothes, inevitably create microplastics in waste water. This is because any clothing, when washed, is consumed in a very small percentage. This must not become a source of panic, but only work for other companies of a completely different type than washing machine manufacturers.
