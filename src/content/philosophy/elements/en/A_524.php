A_524 - By &ldquo;racial color blindness&rdquo; we mean the common error of judgment made in thinking that people of African ethnicity are &ldquo;black&rdquo; and people of Caucasian ethnicity, for example, are &ldquo;white&rdquo;. The truth is that Africans tend to have brown skin, while Caucasians tend to have &ldquo;pink&rdquo; skin. In addition to this, historically the mistake has also been made of thinking that people of Asian origin are &ldquo;yellow&rdquo;: in reality they also have pink skin. Regarding some large murals in which &ldquo;black lives matters&rdquo; is written, we can think that, probably, for some role-playing games to work this type of work of art and protests are necessary, as we cannot know how expensive it could be regenerate certain creatures.
