C_007 - In the past I conceptually designed the possibility of producing enormous plastic wrappers (conceptually enormous plastic bags) that would allow the furniture and also its contents to be isolated from flood water. In this way, in the event of a flood, at least all the furniture and its contents would not have to be thrown away. Of course, it's still not the best, but at least it can still mean not losing all your documentation and personal items, including furniture and home appliances.
