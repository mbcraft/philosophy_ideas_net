A_134 - As far as procreation is concerned, the smartest choice is to transform the moment of procreation into a special moment. If you decide to procreate consciously, assuming all the consequent responsibilities, it may be intelligent to choose a place where you are not disturbed, where perfumes, background music and adequate lights can possibly be diffused. It could also be useful to keep some minerals nearby (quartz, amethyst, etc.) and even the presence of a cat testifying to what happened. It is also worth investing some money in these moments, and absolutely avoiding procreating in the throes of drunkenness, or &ldquo;at random&rdquo;. Personally I believe it is a shame that there are no particular places used exclusively for conscious procreation (near waterfalls, in a forest, in a glacier, in a desert, in a temple...) and that reproduction has always been treated as something of &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo;. It's wrong to think that, and if we think that we need to do some psychological work to clean ourselves up until we feel as clear as water.
