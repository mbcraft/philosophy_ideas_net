H_011 - Having observed statues or drawings or images in which there are human beings mixed with animals, as far as this box of philosophy is concerned, the concept remains that human beings must respect a standard as much as possible (two legs, two arms, a head, possibly 5 fingers for each limb, physical size of both the body and the limbs included within certain parameters ...) since in any case all existing technology is built on the basis of these parameters. In the event of a disability, remedies can still be sought.
