A_364 - There are various types of nightmares: some are simple terror, some are selection tests, others are deliveries of information protected by a casing that guarantees total privacy (since being exposed on social networks, people remotely looking at your photo could interfere in some way), still others have different purposes (e.g. indications of danger regarding possible future personal or work choices). However, they are not useless, and if you want you can also ask if you want to solve particular problems in some way (&ldquo;nightmare as a service&rdquo;). For example, sometimes certain desires are very costly for nature and necessarily imply that in some way one must suffer nightmares during sleep. Remember, however, that this does not imply that psychologists or philosophers are useless (who could also benefit from &ldquo;nightmare as work&rdquo;), and that they can provide you with consulting, advice, or tools of some kind that you may need. Keeping a potted plant near the head of the bed may help.
