A_353 - In philosophy, so as in this collection of concepts, some of them are absolute, while others are just &ldquo;coherent expressions&rdquo;. For example, if I write &ldquo;the sun, the star of the solar system, emits light&rdquo;, or &ldquo;people who dive into lava die&rdquo; these are absolute concepts that cannot be falsified (in a certain sense we could associate them with the concept of 'prime' numbers), while instead for other concepts that I have expressed, in some cases it is possible to create different but still coherent versions, and in other cases &ldquo;reflected&rdquo; versions, a bit like coins, which have 2 sides. Many of the concepts I have expressed can be expanded and covered even more broadly, if and when necessary. In general, Osho taught that by gathering enough arguments for and against, almost any type of philosophical concept can be constructed. It is important to note that science is not debatable and that often certain concepts, when not really based on insufficiently correct or in-depth information, can prove harmful.
