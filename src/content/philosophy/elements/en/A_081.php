A_081 - If you have a wood boiler, remember that it can also be used to burn wood that contains nails. Then remember to remove all the nails from the ash with a magnet. The ash can be used as a fertilizer. Even if the use of wood-burning boilers is strongly discouraged, in some cases it is the only way to dispose of wood that contains nails.
