A_594 - Since umami also exists as a type of flavor, it would be important for foods that have this flavor to be integrated into the diet on a par with the other 4 flavors. For the same reason, as well as the fact that if we have 5 fingers we can use 5 of them, even when it comes to flavours, it makes no sense to neglect and forget this flavour. It too should be integrated into our nutrition in a proportional way compared to the other 4.
