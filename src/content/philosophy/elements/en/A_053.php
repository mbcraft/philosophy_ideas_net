A_053 - Furthermore, as far as love is concerned, I have noticed some differences between the various types of love that I have experienced. In some cases, love allowed me to decide how to behave (for example, in some cases I was able to court girls for some time or decide to interrupt the courtship because I felt it was not correct in relation to the sentimental situation of the other person) but in other cases I have had destructive and adverse reactions to love. Faced with that sweet and pleasant sensation in a couple of cases I reacted with anger, trying to block it and destroy it because of some reason that I absolutely can't explain. One reason could be that the love I received from the other person somehow made me react badly because I still had issues inside me that needed to be resolved.
