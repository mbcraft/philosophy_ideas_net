A_039 - When living with people of the opposite sex, you may experience harassment of varying intensity even without being physically touched. Personally, in those occasions I recommend trying not to fight back but to accept them because they are only a guide to solving problems in the best way. It may not necessarily happen when walking down the street, but I think the same principle applies. In those circumstances it is better to grit your teeth for a moment, bear it, and after a few tens of seconds we will come to understand something completely unknown that will make us act in a different direction. <br />
