A_086 - If you live in the countryside and have large spaces available, a good idea may be to evaluate the possibility of introducing pets to improve the quality of your life. For example, also based on the quantity and type of trees or spaces of a certain type, it may be intelligent to introduce particular animals that are well suited to the presence of that type of space or tree. For example, if there are oaks, a good idea may be to introduce one or more pigs of the same sex so that the acorns do not rot on the ground but become food for them. If there are large spaces goats or cows that graze the grass are suitable, and so on. In any case, there are also animals which in some cases may be a little incompatible with the presence of certain plants, such as chickens which tend to scrape, ruining the presence of small unprotected plants in the garden. By using animals of the same sex, problems related to their multiplication are avoided. This obviously will also involve a certain expense as many of them may require ad hoc food to be purchased at special shops, however remember that the excrement that the various animals produce can be collected, periodically mixed with water and used as a liquid fertilizer for the plants of the garden or trees. This will allow you to improve the health of the trees and the quality of the plants in your garden, for example, and consequently also your profits or the quality of your life.
