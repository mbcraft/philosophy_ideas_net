A_087 - Whatever your passions and hobbies, know that they are by no means useless and that they have both meaning and value to your life. It's not just what you've studied that determines what you're capable of doing, but it's the combination of what you've studied (or learned while working) and your passions that you practice in your free time and the objects you own. As an example, if a cook who went to a certain practical school and is an expert in karate, that person will know how to cook and run a restaurant in a completely different way from a person who went to the same school, with the same grades, but who studied music, or even who took a drawing course and deepened that type of activity. And know that, just as there will be activities in which you will be extremely productive, there will also be others that you will not be able to practice because you would have such disappointing results that you would just demoralize yourself. Just to make you understand, for example, I am absolutely not capable of drawing or playing a musical instrument, and I voluntarily choose to exclude this type of activity from my life because it would just be wasted time and I would have extremely disappointing results. There are tons of things I can't do for a variety of reasons, but I've always chosen to focus on what I knew how to do best and what I could do and focus more and more on that and exclude anything that would almost certainly lead to resounding failures. And also know that this combination of skills and objects that you have chosen for yourself in your life path will always make you extremely performing in certain contexts and extremely uncomfortable and at risk in other contexts. To understand what these situations and contexts are, you will have to observe yourself carefully in some of these situations and use your intuition. This is also somewhat true for the objects you own. There will be some that you will use very often and will be very useful to you, others that will only take the powder. If you can, rationalize your resources, I have sold or given away many things that I no longer use or that I bought thinking that I could exploit them but which in reality have never been of any use to me and I have never really missed them once i got rid of it.
