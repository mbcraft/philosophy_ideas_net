A_106 - If you want to play a little with your partner or friends I recommend the computer game &ldquo;Neverputt&rdquo; (it works on all major operating systems). It's free and just search for it in a search engine to find the download. It's a minigolf simulation and it's extremely simple to play... it's suitable for all ages...
