A_565 - By virtue of what was described previously regarding the prayers, and by virtue of what is described in the book that explains that &ldpos;Music makes tomatoes grow&rdpos; I believe that it is possible, for an orchestra playing classical music in a medium to a forest near rocks, that with the correct intentions and correct execution of musical pieces, it is possible to transform ordinary rocks into precious and valuable minerals. In any case, it may be that obtaining these effects still takes time (at least a few months or perhaps even a year...) and that they are not immediate. Obviously the &ldpos;every better is better&rdpos; described previously also applies: carrying special potted plants, wearing precious jewels, using clothes made only from vegetables, having a certain type of nutrition and lifestyle... is obviously all for the better of the final result.
