A_566 - These are important concepts: the standardization of everything that is produced in large quantities, the clustering (of functionalities in inventions, of products and their types, but not only), respecting medium-high quality standards in everything that is produced for consumption and sale, common sense, the principle of prudence, the separability of the parts and the possibility of recycling the materials of the objects and software, hygiene, decorum. Nobody likes junk, confusion, dirt, ugliness, suffering (in the world we live in). In terms of what is produced, without introducing certain limitations to what can be produced for large-scale use and without intelligent choices regarding the use and disposal of that particular item, problems are inevitable. Introducing restrictions on the types of objects that are produced and standardizing them, clustering them, documenting them is fundamental. For example, it makes no sense that there are different power sockets for domestic homes, as this then complicates the use of some household appliances when travelling, for example. Just as USB ports (of various versions) have been a highly appreciated invention as this standard has made life easier for many people, the same goes for other standards. Even road lanes respect standards, for example, and this is another example that has simplified the lives of many people.
