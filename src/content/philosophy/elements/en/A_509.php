A_509 - Some foods should be thrown away even just 2 days after the expiry date (e.g. bagged salad), while others are still edible even one year after the expiry date (e.g. rusks). In some cases, certain foods (e.g. red turnips) can become slightly moldy if close to expiry, even if stored in the refrigerator, but they can still be washed of mold and eaten.
