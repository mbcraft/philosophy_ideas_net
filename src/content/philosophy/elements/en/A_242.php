A_242 - Just as you walk your pets, the same can be done with potted plants. Be it a visit to a loved one or trekking or the creation of nature documentaries (for example). And it might also improve the experience to bring some minerals or jewels with you in some way. Those who have electric vehicles should remember this (they are more suitable for transporting potted plants because they vibrate less and are less noisy).
