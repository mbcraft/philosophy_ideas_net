A_412 - I confirm the actual existence of voodoo (of which I have understood some concepts) practiced both through more or less crude methods and through the use of technologies. Personally it has been used to my detriment several times and I am ignorant of the consequences. However, this does not mean that this knowledge cannot be reworked and used for &ldquo;useful&rdquo; purposes for the community and not for one's own personal gain. However, I &ldquo;strongly advise against&rdquo; these individuals behaving in a criminal manner as violating meritocracy and altering people's minds in unexpected ways always has harmful and unpredictable consequences, is contrary to science (with all that follows), and in any case, throwing waste in squares, near trees or potted plants in public areas is also against public decency and public health. The theft of the effort of others, through psychological deception, is however to be considered a crime.
