A_522 - It is important to remember that all objects, including digital ones, are considered resources and as such must be managed. It makes no sense to buy books so as not to read them, games so as not to play them, or objects thinking that their possession does not also imply a certain responsibility in their ownership. Sometimes, perhaps, it can also happen to be blocked for reasons like these. If an object is not used at all, it is better to try to sell it or give it away to other people who can make better use of it rather than &ldquo;keeping it gathering dust&rdquo;.
