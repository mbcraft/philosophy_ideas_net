A_385 - When, unfortunately, large fish die on the beach for unknown reasons, the most intelligent action that can be taken is to slaughter them as quickly as possible (so that they do not rot) and use that meat as food for animals (e.g. dogs , cats ...). The bones can be ground and used as fertilizer.
