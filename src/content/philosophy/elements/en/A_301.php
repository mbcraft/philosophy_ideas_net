A_301 - For women who want to experiment, you can try placing a sufficiently large seed of a plant inside the vagina for a few days before sowing it and letting it grow (no bulbs) or even small leaves or rounded hard stones of different minerals, or possibly a small mint. There should be some positive consequences. In any case I cannot take on these experiments. Be careful if you try some.
