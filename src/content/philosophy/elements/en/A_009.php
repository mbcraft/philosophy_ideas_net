A_009 - Adopt a vegan/plant based or fruitarian nutrition if possible. Exclude products made with parts of animal origin (excluding wool and silk produced in an animal-friendly manner).  Personally I recommend a breakfast of fruit only or fruit and vegetable smoothies. It's excellent for starting the day with a sprint and has never caused me any energy deficit. As far as meat or fish is concerned, many are in love with its flavour, but they don't know that the effect on the body is disastrous. Eating meat or fish creates putridity in the stomach. Salad is exactly the opposite: it puts up resistance in our mind when we try to eat it but then it gives incredible benefits to our body. I have personally seen visible positive effects trying to eat salad consistently for lunch and dinner after only two days with excellent benefits. I also happened to observe pieces of meat that shine almost as if they were magical or to smell an extremely pleasant smell, but in any case even in those cases it is better not to give in to temptation. However, on a conceptual level, it is undeniable that animals, by nature, have the right to move and that they scream or try to save themselves when a person tries to kill them, so depriving them of this right to move is still a crime against nature. Also for this reason, intensive farming is terrible and those who support them by purchasing that type of food product must also somehow deal with the fact that in some way, in the future, they will have to pay on a personal or working level for their choice. not very intelligent. In any case, vegetables are also living beings and to be intellectually honest I must say that we kill them to eat them, but it is equally true that some would still die at the end of the season (therefore, unlike intensively farmed animals, conceptually it is not as serious), and this is why, ultimately, fruit is the best food ever.<br />
