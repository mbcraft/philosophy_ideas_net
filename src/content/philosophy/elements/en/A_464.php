A_464 - I have personally observed a significant interaction between the transistors of an LCD television and the use of wireless via a router transmitting in 2.4 G. While updating apps on the smartphone and intensive use of that transmission band (WIFI + 2.4 G) the television could not display the channels. In general, these unpleasant interactions between technologies exist and are almost always discovered over time. However, these unexpected interactions occur not only between objects, but also between people and objects, and can be both favorable and unfavorable. In general, however, when using more or less cutting-edge technologies (or interacting with certain people) it is always better to be careful.
