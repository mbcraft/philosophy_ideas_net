A_469 - &ldquo;Clock madness&rdquo; is the difficulty of keeping all the devices aligned that indicate the current time correctly. Computers, wristwatches, alarm clocks, microwave ovens, etc... often have misaligned time. The difficulty of measuring time and the problem of measuring time, however, is not easy to manage and is always relative to position in space. For example, it is not at all trivial for a probe on Mars or around Saturn to understand &ldquo;what time it is&rdquo;... based on what criteria?
