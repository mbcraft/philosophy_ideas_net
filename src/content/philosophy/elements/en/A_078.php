A_078 - Certain &ldquo;apparently useless&rdquo; voluntary work such as the collection of mad chestnuts to be used as food for pigs in sanctuaries, or litterpicking have significant health benefits, they are not just a good social work. It also applies to those who collect dog excrement to make fertilizer from the streets of cities where they shouldn't be. And if they are done without complaining or cursing the incivility of others, they are even more useful. I speak from personal experience.
