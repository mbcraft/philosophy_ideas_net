A_390 - Sometimes certain results that seem impossible just require a correct understanding of the situation. For example, if the objective is to warm yourself up, you can do it either by burning â‚¬50 banknotes or recycled wood. It is easy to understand that in one case, although the final result achieved is the same, by burning banknotes you warm up but ruin yourself, in the other case you have only found a wise way of managing resources. The same can also apply to people of the opposite sex. Clarify within yourself what you are looking for. Are you looking for a person with a beautiful body because you like observing beauty? Are you looking for a person who makes you feel emotionally good? Are you looking for someone to entertain you and have fun with? Are you looking for a person who has certain skills and work skills? Are you looking for a person who has economic resources to share in exchange for something else? It is quite clear that if you are only looking for something very specific it will be very easy to find it, whereas if you look for everything together it could obviously be much more difficult to find, or in any case it might not be particularly sustainable in the long term. Also know that for example fun, positive emotions, economic resources and other even very pleasant experiences can still be found in any case even if they are not necessarily associated with people.
