C_004 - I think it would be interesting to create manually operated composters with a crank that allow the non-woody remains of food waste (fruit and vegetables) to be finely ground. Sometimes it happens that precisely because the food waste is too coarse, the composting process is not successful. Possibly this mechanical mill could also be separated from the actual composter, and in this way it would also be possible to use non-mechanical but simply rotating composters already on the market rather easily.
