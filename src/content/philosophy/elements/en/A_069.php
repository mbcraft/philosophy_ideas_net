A_069 - The quality of thoughts of each of us depends on the degree of mental hygiene that a person has. In general, based on what we eat, how much experience we have with meditation, the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the situations we are experiencing and our past experiences, the quality of the thoughts we have can vary greatly. It's good to remember that not everything we think can be of value and that some poor quality thoughts that we have should only be trashed.
