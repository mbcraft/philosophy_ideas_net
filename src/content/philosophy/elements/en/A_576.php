A_576 - Nature has always tried to tell us through nefarious events what is wrong with our philosophy. When nefarious events happen it is always because there are philosophical shortcomings or problems that are indicated and for which we must make changes or find solutions. As far as I am concerned I also see in the recent murders or feminicides discussed in the news references to the wrong philosophy that was waiting to be fixed, but the same is also true for events that have happened less recently. It is always important to try to read events with a different key to understand if there are indications that are expressed in some way. Falcone and Borsellino, the Capaci massacre, are events that indicated something and the surnames themselves say so. They were other underground phenomena that little was known about, but if you look at the assets of Sicilians and Calabrians compared to that of other Italians perhaps you can get important information. The same goes for other trials that have recently taken place, such as those of Rosa and Olindo, of Giulia Checchettin, of Bruno Bozzoli, these too are not surnames that mean nothing and are in reality indications of problems that needed to be resolved before these events occurred. Having said this, it could still be useful to go back in time and analyze all the dramas that have taken place to understand if there were philosophical errors or problems that were somehow indicated, and highlight them. (I also spoke about Pompeii and Herculaneum in this regard ...).
