A_623 - It is important not to insult politicians and not to treat them as targets for mud because hitting them means hitting all the citizens those people govern, therefore it is not good behavior at all and I strongly advise against it. It is enough to ask questions and if there are observations to make I refer back to the previous point: the people who govern cannot know what the problems are if the people do not report them to them with the appropriate tools instead of only reporting them when it is necessary to insult them on social networks. This behavior that I have observed many times is truly reprehensible. If there are problems in the territory they should be reported with the appropriate tools and always with courtesy.
