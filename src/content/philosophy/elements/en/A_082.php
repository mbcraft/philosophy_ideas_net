A_082 - If you want to be able to eat bread that is always fragrant and you have a freezer, you can do as I explain. Buy some bread, cut it into slices and then put it in the freezer. Then when you have to eat it, take it out of the freezer, put it on a plate and heat it up. At that point it will be fragrant and you can eat it. It remains extremely tasty.
