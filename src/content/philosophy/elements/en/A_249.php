A_249 - There are filter jugs with interchangeable filters on the market. The filter is usually a plastic container with what is needed to filter the water inside. To be disposed of in the best possible way it is necessary to cut or open the plastic container (with very sturdy scissors). The contents can be used as an inert material for plant soil.
