A_105 - Sometimes it can happen to buy some defective product. Very often it is better not to be too squeamish about small defects because it is not absolutely necessary: they only create waste unnecessarily. It happened to me to buy an office chair with a broken armrest, or a video card that in some cases shows green pixels for no reason, just to give a couple of examples ... in other cases, however, I happened to buy products that they were useless by how defective they were, like shoes so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear them without making my foot bleed, or prisms that didn't make a rainbow. You have to evaluate it on a case-by-case basis ...
