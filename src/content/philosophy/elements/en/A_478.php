A_478 - If you want to stimulate the trees in your garden, you can possibly take a pair of scissors, hold them with both hands, and using a lot of anger, cleanly cut a single leaf so as to remove it completely. The important thing is to choose an ugly and deformed leaf and try to perform the gesture with maximum epicness. However, pruning or pollarding of any kind, unless there is obstruction of means of transport or pedestrian passage, must be absolutely avoided. In any case, it will perhaps take a couple of days for the effect to occur: you will feel a very strong sensation somewhere in the body in a very specific point. In any case it will help you on a psychological level.
