A_002 - Human beings tend to perceive &ldquo;by difference&rdquo; and evaluate what is happening based on their &ldquo;mental hooks&rdquo;. This is why having different experiences and even outside the comfort zone helps us. It is stretching for our mind. And another thing to keep in mind is that if you stay in your comfort zone after doing these &ldquo;stretchings&rdquo;, over time, slowly, your mind will tend to gray and flatten out, unless you do these experiences again.
