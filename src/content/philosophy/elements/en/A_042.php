A_042 - Personally I think it is better to bury the dead underground, without a coffin but simply wrapped in cotton. I think the niches would be better used as containers for the objects that belonged to the deceased, placing a glass plate that allows loved ones but also other people to look at those objects and understand the life that person lived. I think it would be a much better way to remember the deceased, to understand how they lived, transforming the cemetery into a sort of museum of the past. Otherwise, an alternative and better idea could be to use the flesh of the deceased to make food for carnivorous animals, to bury the uneaten remains underground and to crumble the bones into powder to make organic fertilizer. The bone powder should be mixed with spring water, possibly also using water from different and distant sources to produce many different fertilizers. As for this fertilizer, it should preferably be used to fertilize trees in very distant and different places. Such fertilizers would be better transported by non-motorized vehicles, also trying to whistle along the way. Live music may be played during the ceremony where this manure is poured near the roots of the trees, essences and perfumes could be spread. People could also stand barefoot on the grass and have pets with them. Also at a banquet, fresh fruit might be handed out for the attendees. They may seem to you somewhat strong or &ldquo;chilling&rdquo; concepts, but know that this &ldquo;circularity&rdquo; with regard to the remains of the deceased is the wisest thing you can do to better respect nature and help people to be more happy. Or even using the deceased as food for lions, vultures, alligators, sharks or piranhas makes much more sense to me than making another dead (the tree from which wood is made for the coffin) to let them mold inside. Naturally what I have exposed is the most extensive and demanding version of the funeral... they can also be done without pilgrimages...<br />
