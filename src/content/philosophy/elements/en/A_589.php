A_589 - In Italian the word "bubble" has several different meanings, while from what I understand in the English language the word "bubble" is used with the exact same meaning. As regards soap bubbles, however, it is not forbidden to blow them between the rows of fruit trees, in gardens, nor to install systems that emit bubbles in certain public parks. We know that, for example, music has very positive effects on tomatoes (there is a book that describes this discovery) and it is not certain that even making soap bubbles that reach the leaves of the plants cannot still be used to "entertain them" (for example using bubble shooters). In addition to this, it is important that there are no substances of animal origin in the soap bubbles, but only vegetables or minerals. It must be said that we have often used bubbles made with soap, but nothing prevents the addition of other substances that can in some way be beneficial for the health of plants or fertilizers. In addition to this, it is not said that they cannot also be used on construction sites where certain very tiring jobs are carried out (e.g. road jobs) to make the work psychologically easier.
