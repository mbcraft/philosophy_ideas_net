A_058 - I discovered that the presence of minerals nearby can cause concrete and experimentally perceptible effects on our body. Personally I have very few left because the ones I had I gave them away a long time ago. However I have experienced that the quartz as big and long as about 2 fingers side by side that I own, if present near me, over time transforms my consciousness making it become more &ldquo;aerial&rdquo; (I find it hard to explain) and makes it almost impossible for me to concentrate to work. I also noticed that in the presence of quartz, watching a documentary on the deep sea I perceived the fish as if they were real fish, while instead looking at an image of &ldquo;cattivik&rdquo; or &ldquo;venom&rdquo; I had the sensation that it became more and more evil in front of to me. This is explained precisely because quartz lightens our awareness, and therefore since we &ldquo;perceive by difference&rdquo; this particular effect is obtained. I suppose these minerals when used in places like spas or meditation centers could lead to considerable benefits. I don't know anything about crystal healing, but these are my personal experiences. I had to remove the quartz from the room because I couldn't concentrate anymore to work, and I discovered it on my skin that had this particular effect. I also found that having mineral bracelets under my pillow caused headaches when trying to sleep.
