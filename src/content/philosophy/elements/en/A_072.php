A_072 - If you eat food that is too greasy or in excessive quantities, you may feel a little heavy mentally, sleepy and distracted. In case you decide to eat other greasy food (it's a temptation that can happen in those moments of heaviness) I suggest you eat some dry food instead, such as nuts (walnuts, peanuts, hazelnuts, almonds). It will help you break hunger and recover from heaviness.
