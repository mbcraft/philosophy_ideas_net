A_425 - Personally I hypothesize that the existence of porn films, considering the fact that we have no shortage of armed conflicts and garbage in the streets, is another sign that there are clear signs of purposely ruining other people's lives and jobs to take advantage of them, considering how much degradation exists and how much we could beautify and improve the world we live in.
