A_265 - Condoms in sexual intercourse should not be used to prevent births, but to find particular types of sons/daughters. When using condoms you have to have sexual intercourse as wildly as possible (at your own risk), if the condom breaks (without cheating) you have to accept the situation without using any type of contraceptives.
