A_595 - My opinion regarding couples arguments is the following: women are always right and men are always right. That is: when a woman complains, the man should try to solve her problems without complaining and without arguing, and the same should happen in the situation in which it is the man who complains and the woman must resolve the problems of she. Of course this is just my opinion... naturally the less irritated you complain the better... because clearly complaints are never pleasant to hear, neither for the man nor for the woman...
