A_456 - In some places there are what are called &ldquo;soffioni&rdquo;, plants with a part that detaches thanks to the presence of the wind. If they are present in large numbers it is a great idea to use one of those tools used to move the foliage with a jet of air in order to work them correctly. The same can also be done with trees that have a seed that requires the presence of wind for its propagation.
