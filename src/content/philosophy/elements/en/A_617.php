A_617 - If you have some fried foods and you weren't able to finish them in the current meal and you want to save them for the next one, the best advice I can give you is to put a paper bag around them and then close everything in a plastic bag. The paper bag will absorb moisture instead of the fried food, while the closed plastic bag will not let any more in. Just like you can do for bread, the same method should also work with fried foods.
