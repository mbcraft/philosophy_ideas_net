A_558 - I personally advise all food manufacturers against printing recipes on the package label. It's a bad idea for various reasons: the first is that people easily confuse the ingredients of the product, the second is that it becomes a nightmare for foreign people who go shopping if they have particular preferences or food intolerances. If they want to include recipes, I recommend inserting mini-leaflets inside the package, or printing a QR code on the package and posting them online. In general, trying to internationalize the ingredient list is a good direction to follow.
