A_180 - It would be best not to perform fellatio on people who are worthy of procreating or for whom it would be better to procreate, but only on those who would be better off not procreating. Probably in the times of ancient Rome it is probable that they were used excessively and that certain tragedies that occurred (the eruption of the volcano on the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum) occurred only because of this collective error. In any case, if a man feels it is time to procreate after having committed himself to chastity for a long time, it is probably much wiser to seek out a woman who is willing to procreate than to use his own sperm otherwise.
