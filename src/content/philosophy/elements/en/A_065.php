A_065 - Personally I think it would be nice if objects in general were always easily removable, repairable or easily recyclable in their various parts. Clearly it is not easy for those who produce them to be able to obtain this result, but I believe that great steps forward can be made in this direction. This is because I believe that the use of &ldquo;undifferentiated&rdquo; waste tends to be minimized as much as possible. Extracting new metals, new minerals, etc. involves a non-negligible cost. For example, my mother had to throw away a washing machine simply because it was not possible to clean its buttons from dust, and the button panel was not removable because it had been assembled with a one-way joint. This is just to give an example. Just as I believe it makes no sense to continue buying pods for coffee machines when there are refillable capsules. Now I understand that the manufacturing companies needed to collect some money to be able to continue their work, but if conceptually they had immediately supplied ground coffee and refillable capsules and asked to use only the ground coffee produced by them or to pay a &ldquo;monthly subscription&rdquo; as we do with other services, a not negligible quantity of undifferentiated garbage would have been avoided. In any case, given that capsules exist, I want to remind the manufacturing companies that you can also put many different types of herbal teas inside them and that the capsules should in any case be disposed of not in undifferentiated waste (it's ok if they are collected door to door or managed as type of waste separately).
