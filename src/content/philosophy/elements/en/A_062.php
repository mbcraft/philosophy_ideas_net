A_062 - Sometimes it's not easy to convince people of your opinion, but it's perfectly normal for this to happen. This is because in order to receive and accept an opinion or information it is necessary for that person to have a whole context of correlated information available which allow him or her to evaluate and accept this opinion as valid. Otherwise, if he or she has different or false or incomplete information, it is absolutely normal that that person is unable to accept a valid opinion as such.
