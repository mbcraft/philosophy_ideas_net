A_395 - Personally, I recommend keeping all the passwords used in a special notebook where we can also write down any subsequent changes. However, this does not mean that any keystore applications cannot be used. However, this does not mean that any keystore applications cannot be used, but I believe that this system is far healthier. In addition to this, I also leave you with another piece of advice: there are many ways, even without knowing strange and mysterious alphabets, to encrypt passwords. I'll list some of them:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Add a character or number in a position that only you know.</li>
	<li>Transform some characters or numbers according to a method that only you know.</li>
	<li>Omit a character or number in a position that only you know.</li>
</ul>
<br />
In this way your notebooks (which if they are small can also fit in a bag in case of travel) are also theft-proof. This also allows you to protect yourself from partners or cohabitants in the event of severely problematic attitudes.
