A_156 - I tend to think it's not a very smart choice for people with a body that shows signs of old age to accumulate too much money in retirement and ruin themselves from fatigue, it might be smarter to give the money to some young person so as not to keep them stuck and live a more restful life. Generally, accumulating resources (of any kind: houses, money, bicycles...) and leaving them to age over time doesn't make much sense to me.
