A_092 - In my opinion it doesn't make much sense for people in condominiums to &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; that the other inhabitants of the condominium almost don't exist, but I think it makes much more sense to take advantage of the condominium to experience the concept of &ldquo;community&rdquo;, frequenting and interacting frequently with the other condominiums in so as to exploit the closeness of those people on an interpersonal level. Exchanging work services (cooking, cleaning the premises, assistance, etc.) should be the norm, precisely so as to make the most of the time and skills of the people who live there. It would also make sense to create companies inside the condominiums in which to make the various inhabitants of the condominium work according to their skills, as everyone would have their own personal spaces adjacent to the working ones and this would lead to a drastic reduction in traffic on the streets. For example, if a painter lives in a condominium, it makes no sense for this person to paint only for himself, he might as well undertake to fill at least the entire condominium with art. If a person is an expert in plants, or is an excellent cook, it doesn't make sense to have him work only &ldquo;small&rdquo; in his apartment, but it makes sense to extend his work or his passions to the whole condominium. This is because the more different tasks you have to do, the less you can be efficient, so in this way you focus on quality rather than getting stuck in a climate of fragmentation and drastically improve people's overall satisfaction. Analogous reasoning can be done with skyscrapers.
