A_373 - Just as in certain moments super-fast decisions are fundamental (e.g. when someone nearby falls ill, or if an appliance has caught fire...), it is equally important in other situations not to be impulsive but to let a few days pass or even more time before making certain evaluations or making certain decisions, because sometimes other people also need time to react to certain problems, so waiting could be a good idea, in a certain sense, to support them.
