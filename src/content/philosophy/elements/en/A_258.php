A_258 - A very nice idea is to play chess or checkers with very small potted plants, using one type of plant for each type of chess piece. To play checkers you need special supports to place the plants one on top of the other, or use different plants for the &ldquo;big checkers&rdquo;. If you want, you can also play &ldquo;live&rdquo; sudoku with the same mechanism, assigning each plant a number and positioning them appropriately to solve the pattern (which can also be taken from a magazine and then transcribed in the magazine once solved). Remember to burn the magazine once you have completed all the sudoku puzzles.
