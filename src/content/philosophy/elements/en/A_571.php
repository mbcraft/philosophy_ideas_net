A_571 - Contrary to what you might think, not all people born on the equator have dark skin: the original Incas and Mexican populations, for example, have always had light complexions. In addition to this, it must be said that civilizations like the Incas were anything but &ldpos;slackers&rdpos;, and this can be understood very well by observing, for example, places like &ldpos;Machu Picchu&rdpos;, where a city was built with heavy stones in high mountain. To consider the importance of a monument, people should also consider how much work was necessary to create it: if on the one hand we can be proud of certain monuments such as Stonehenge or the Colosseum (and of the work that was necessary to create them), at the same way we should also consider other monuments like &ldpos;Machu Picchu&rdpos; and the amount of work that was necessary to create them, and understand that in any case, if those places were then abandoned AFTER ALL THE IMMENSE WORK THAT HAD BEEN DONE, something terrible is happened to those people since time immemorial. It is very likely that someone carried out an experiment by wearing a metal helmet, and bringing his hand closer to the ground thinking of absorbing who knows what power, but most likely due to the helmet the trees were unable to protect him and the intentions of the worms entered into that person. We don't know what he did next, but it is likely that the Incas civilization was ruined because of that experiment. However, the existence of that statuette also indicates that they already knew how to make metal objects (The helmet depicted is that of 'Magneto', a Marvel character, while the &ldpos;good&rdpos; one is called Xavier, which perhaps indicates &ldpos;wise&rdpos;).
