A_404 - As far as construction is concerned, it might make sense to build condominiums not in the city centre, but on the contrary in the countryside. While on the one hand this would improve the availability of staff, on the other it would allow many people (all of them) to enjoy a very large garden and not hear traffic noise. Of course this is just an idea, with many implications, but I think it can still serve as food for thought to analyze other little-explored city design models.
