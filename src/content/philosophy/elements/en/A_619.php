A_619 - It would be smart if the new generations also thought a little about the old ones, about those people who need to be emotionally settled a little and who have never found their better half. With their love they can do a lot, they can make them shine a little, just enough to be able to help them find their better half. Without that love, sometimes people were never able to settle down and remained alone, unable to reach those who could even just keep them company.
