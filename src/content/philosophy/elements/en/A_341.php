A_341 - It happens that when we let a cat enter or exit the house by opening a door or window, it stops for a few moments in the middle of the opening (this is typically their behaviour). The animal makes its assessments and decides whether to enter or not and I personally recommend waiting patiently until it makes its decision independently, without applying pressure of any kind.
