A_483 - The meaning of the Christian cross differs depending on its use: when it is placed on a grave it indicates &ldquo;here is a dead person&rdquo;. When worn around the neck it indicates that comfort is offered for the dead souls. When it is hung on the walls it tends to indicate the historical episode linked to the life of Jesus and his crucifixion. When the cross is upside down it indicates &ldquo;blessing coming from heaven&rdquo;. The meaning of the circle, as a symbol, is to indicate the planet, the cell, personal integrity. I associate the meaning of the triangle, as a symbol, with precision. I associate the meaning of the square, as a symbol, to solidity. The X has multiple meanings, among which I find &ldquo;objective&rdquo;, &ldquo;error&rdquo;, &ldquo;position marker&rdquo;, &ldquo;mark&rdquo;. As regards the symbols that indicate man and woman, starting from the symbol of the circle and analyzing the remaining parts one can understand its meaning: for the man the arrow is a symbol of direction to be taken and decision, while for the woman the + is a symbol of fertility. This is because historically the older and more experienced man makes better decisions thanks to his better experience, while the woman, being historically younger in couples, represents the energies. These are obviously my personal interpretations, more or less acceptable.
