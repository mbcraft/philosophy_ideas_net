A_628 - It is important that people within the same nation are united as a people and that there are no unnecessary divisions and oppositions. It is important that they are in solidarity with each other and that they give priority to each other, regardless of the nation to which they belong. It is important that the people contribute to the well-being of the nation not so much because the government taxes them, but that they do so actively as much as possible. It is not intelligent that there are divisions and struggles between people within the same nation, because this would demonstrate that it lacks patriotism and these internal divisions would only be wastes that consume people opposed to each other, instead of using their energies for something positive that they could also achieve as a personal interest or in their free time.
