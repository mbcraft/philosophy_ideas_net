If you are too tired and eat poor quality food, the emotional outcome will be quite disastrous. Don't make this mistake. Investing in good, healthy food is a very smart way to spend your money. Because remember that beyond any technology or object that you can use, your whole life inexorably starts from yourself, from your organism.
