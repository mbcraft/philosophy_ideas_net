A_366 - As regards the Catholic Church, the following interpretation is provided:
The Italian words &ldquo;Chiesa&rdquo; means &ldquo;Who is knows&rdquo; - The word &ldquo;Cattolica&rdquo; means &ldquo;Cats are Holy in Houses&rdquo;, so who is alive has knowledge and cats in the house are holy. Regarding the main characters of the Bible: God (&ldquo;Dio&rdquo; in the Italian word), indicates all conscious living beings (D'io means &ldquo;made of coscience&rdquo;), Joseph in Italian is &ldquo;Giu-Seppe&rdquo;, or the roots of trees that have found fertilizer and have learned something, the Virgin Mary indicates the breath of pure air (in Italian) : Mhh-Aria. Jesus indicates both male erection (Ge-Su : Ge-Up) and female orgasm (G-is-up). Judas represents the one who frequently fertilized trees and helped nature: give me in the bottom (Giu-da in Italian). It may be that Jesus was &ldquo;betrayed by Judas&rdquo; because he was too busy having sexual intercourse, forgetting to inform people of how important it was to fertilize the trees, thus deserving death. Given this &ldquo;Pre-te&rdquo; (means &ldquo;in favor of tea&rdquo;, meditation, connection with Buddhism), &ldquo;Suo-ra&rdquo; (indication of the inner sun, connection with the Egyptian civilization of the pharaohs) they can work with the tools they already know. For example, the blessing, as the Italian word itself says, also serves to maintain the correct pronunciation of words which with today's technology (smartphones, automatic correctors) is suffering damage or in any case requires maintenance. However, Catholic Church operators are invited to always provide the text of the blessings, prayers or cerimonies, as in this way they can also possibly change and improve them. Knowing the above, it is easy to understand that the Catholic Church also has its importance and that people can visit the Churches, attain the cerimonies and obtain results. This is the explanation of my interpretation of the Italian words about Catholic Church. In any case, I am not an expert on prayer, further considerations on it will possibly be shared in the future. However, I believe that they are quite the mirror image of meditation.
