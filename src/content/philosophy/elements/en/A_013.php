A_013 - As regards the current intensive farming techniques for fruit production, I wanted to make some considerations. At present, intensive agriculture involves the use of harvesting tractors and wagons and annual pruning. This makes it possible to create systems which however have a limited life: after about 20 years all the trees (which have ceased to be productive) must be uprooted, sawn, the systems dismantled, the fields re-ploughed, the systems (with poles and cables) replanted and the new trees replanted. This involves a large amount of work. Furthermore, the new plants will not be productive for at least 6-7 years. Furthermore, this type of agriculture substantially obliges the practice of beekeeping to favor the pollination of trees, since if the hives were attached to the trees they would be destroyed with the end of the life of the plant.
In India there are ancient fruit trees (they are mango trees) several hundred years old that produce fruit continuously, without dying. It can be understood that the lack of downtime in the production and the continuous growth of these trees lead to the production of a substantially much higher volume of fruit, which also turns out to be extremely tasty. This type of trees, not dying, could also allow the use of natural beehives, attached to those same trees. The real challenge, in reality, is that of harvesting: at the moment our current technologies do not allow us to collect fruit from the highest branches or from trees that tend to be very large. This can be true for mango trees but also for cherry trees: the problem remains the same. It is said that the presence of better technologies cannot allow us to use these 'permanent plants' for the production of fruit.
