A_026 - If you find dead animals or their remains it is better not to leave them where they are unless there are animals that feed on them (lions, vultures, hyenas ...). It is also better not to throw them in the garbage, if you have the opportunity to bury them in the ground or ask who can do it. If you bury an animal after you have buried it you can use the &ldquo;sign of the sphere&rdquo;, which consists in rotating the hand forming a circle several times. It represents the sun, the stars, peace and serenity.
