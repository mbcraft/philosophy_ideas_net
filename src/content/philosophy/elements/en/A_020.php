A_020 - Litter abandoned in the environment causes problems for animals and people. Personally I believe that waste management should be a central theme of society and not something marginal as there is the risk of ruining the environment and consequently of collapsing everything that had been painstakingly built. It can also happen to feel tempted to throw garbage in the environment and to think that we will receive some strange reward or power, or to think that it is right at that moment to do so. Even in those cases we must resist those temptations and never throw waste into the environment.<br />
