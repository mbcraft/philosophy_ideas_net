A_097 - Some diseases also have reflections in our mind: I'm not just talking about feelings of suffering, but I'm talking about real errors in our logical and mathematical reasoning. As strange as it may seem, even repeating the multiplication tables with a sheet of paper, or solving certain mathematical problems can be a way to unblock the situation of the immune system. In fact, if we find a real flaw in our way of reasoning and we remedy it, in the same way the immune system, faced with a threat that it could not manage, will find a way to overcome that gap. These hidden problems can concern the most disparate parts of our mind, from those that manage the ability to do mathematical calculations to that which controls the motor system. Finding them, observing them and overcoming them is one way to help the immune system do its job.
