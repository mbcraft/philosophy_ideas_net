A_059 - Sometimes it can happen that you lie down after eating. This can lead, for example, to having air in the belly at a later time. If you can walk a bit (even inside a room) in order to make the stomach swing with this procedure, the air tends to go out and digestion tends to improve. Air in the stomach is not a friend to good digestion.
