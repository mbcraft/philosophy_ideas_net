A_305 - In my opinion it would be a good idea to ensure that those who undergo chemical or surgical castration without having had children can be guaranteed a non-falsifiable paper certificate but also digitally saved in a block-chain which certifies its actual execution and which can be used as a travel ticket to travel by public transport anywhere for free (using buses, subways, trains, planes...). In addition to this, even those who have reached retirement age without having children should perhaps be entitled to this travel pass for free. Of course this is just my idea and my opinion.
