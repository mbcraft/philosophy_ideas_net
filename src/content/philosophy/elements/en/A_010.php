A_010 - As far as meals are concerned, during meals we tend to relax and favor the tastiest food choices instead of the healthier ones. If you are able to commit yourself for a moment and make an effort to prefer the healthiest foods, you are able to obtain long-term benefits that allow you to gradually improve the quality of your life, otherwise if you choose the more gluttonous and unhealthy foods, you enjoy the flavor in the short term but there are worse results in the long run.
