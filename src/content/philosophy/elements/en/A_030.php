A_030 - If you have cats that go where they shouldn't go (for example on the shelves where you cook) I learned this method to teach them not to go there. When you catch them in the act, bring your hand to the cat's head and with your index finger repeatedly touch the center of the cat's forehead with a frequency of about one touch per second. The cat will immediately show visibly annoyed, until, by dint of persevering with your touches, he will decide to get off and leave. The cat can't stand this gesture of touching his forehead, so just use this to teach him where not to go.
