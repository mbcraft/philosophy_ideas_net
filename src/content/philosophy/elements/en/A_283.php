A_283 - Whenever possible, for those who own both a smartphone and a computer and need to chat and have both at hand, I always recommend chatting using applications on the computer instead of using the smartphone. This generally leads to much better quality conversations that are more complete, richer and more nuanced. Personally I see the smartphone as a tool designed for use &ldquo;on the go&rdquo; or for those who don't own a computer. I understand that perhaps sometimes it can be a bit of a hassle to turn on the computer even just to chat, but I guarantee that the difference in the communication results obtained (both in work and personal contexts) is truly abysmal. Broadly speaking, the quality of a communication managed with chat via computer rather than with chat via smartphone is about 8-10 times better (in my opinion).
