A_422 - As far as I'm concerned, I don't think I possess more than 0.0001% of the knowledge or skills that can be learned via the internet or paper or digital books. Mine is an optimistic estimate and I believe that the real percentage is much, much lower. In addition to this, I have had the opportunity to notice that the psychological and character differences of people can be very many, precisely due to the vast availability of knowledge, experiences, objects, etc... Having said this, it must also be said that our organism and our mind are shaped based on how we use them and that certain knowledge and skills, even if learned in the past, are somehow forgotten if they are not used or if they are experiences which for unknown reasons are in some way &ldquo;in conflict&rdquo;.
