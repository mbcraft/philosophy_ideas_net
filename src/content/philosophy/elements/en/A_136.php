A_136 - As far as farming goes, I personally believe there is nothing wrong with raising animals. The right way to do business with animals (let's assume in this case cattle) is not to slaughter them and sell their meat, but to collect their excrement and use it in agriculture. They are precious, they have a very specific economic value as they contribute to improving the health of plants and producing better quality fruit and vegetables. Furthermore, it is not certain that these animals, once dead, cannot actually be &ldquo;processed&rdquo; by a butcher, to reuse that meat as food for carnivorous animals (dogs, crocodiles, lions, sharks, etc.), and also use the bones to make agricultural fertilizer. It is possible to use motor wheelbarrows for this phase of collecting excrement scattered across the pastures to facilitate the work, and to use separate motor wheelbarrows for the collection phase of the slaughtered remains of the dead animal. In addition to this way of doing business, in any case, there is also the possibility of creating agritourisms, or to organize parties taking advantage of the large spaces.
