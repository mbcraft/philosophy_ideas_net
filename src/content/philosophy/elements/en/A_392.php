A_392 - Regarding some previously known philosophical concepts such as &ldquo;do not steal&rdquo; or &ldquo;do not kill&rdquo;, it must be clarified that these are not absolute concepts but relative concepts. If a thief breaks a wall with a grating of a poor family to enter a house and steal some change, it is clear that it is a deplorable gesture, but if a very intelligent thief studying the security systems of a museum steals a work of art by overcoming very sophisticated security systems without breaking anything and gives it to a child in a kindergarten, so in this case &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; is actually a gesture that deserves respect, prestige and admiration. Similar reasoning can also be made for &ldquo;not killing&rdquo;, given that I have written that reincarnation exists and that ultimately many of the plants we eat are also killed.
