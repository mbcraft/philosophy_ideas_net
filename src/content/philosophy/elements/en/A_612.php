A_612 - For people who appreciate the chocolatey flavor, I recommend gradually switching from drinking coffee to drinking liquid chocolate. Simply put, bitter cocoa, when there is also sugar in the liquid, dissolves and mixes, provided that there are no additives. I have tried with two different brands of product and with one it works but not with the other. It is the presence of sugar that makes bitter cocoa dissolve better, it is not just the temperature of the liquid as many might think. Bitter cocoa dissolves and becomes drinkable even in cold water, the important thing is that there is enough sugar and there are no additives that prevent it. This suggestion of mine comes from the fact that coffee, being roasted, is bad for the stomach, while cocoa, being bitter but not roasted, does not have this harmful effect on the stomach.
