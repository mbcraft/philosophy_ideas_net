A_591 - It is important to remember that the hair brushed by animals can be collected in jars and sent to those who have vegetable gardens or plants in the garden and that it can be buried and used as fertilizer. It is organic material. There is no point in putting it in the unsorted waste container, because in that case it goes to waste. Since they are light, it may be better to put them in contact with mud so that the wind does not disperse them, and in the meantime they are still decomposed. The same goes for hair, it might be helpful to keep it in containers with moist soil so that it doesn't accidentally get lost.
