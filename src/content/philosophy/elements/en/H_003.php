H_003 - Many of the concepts, posts, files, videos that I have shared through this website or my social network profiles are the point of connection for ideas that allow new types of work (but not only) or the modification of existing ones , and which in certain cases also require the creation of certain machinery and/or certain software, or studies and in-depth studies for their correct implementation and development... the same also applies to information or philosophies regarding personal development. Clearly this information represents my point of view and is based heavily on my past experiences, but it is still based on assessments that I have considered valid and reliable and largely also experienced by me. It is likely that the use of these concepts will lead to deprecating some objects or information previously considered useful and valuable.
