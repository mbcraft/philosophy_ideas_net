A_050 - Another very effective technique when your heart is aching is to sit outside and wait for flies to arrive. At that point the eyes are closed and the flies are left free to explore our face, even if they approach or slip slightly in the ears, nose or eyes, enduring the tickle without ever crushing them. It's not easy to do it but if you can bear it you can heal even devastating emotional wounds. This happens because in those moments of enduring those tickling sensations we do a particular muscular gymnastics which has the very effect of healing us from certain emotional wounds. In the absence of flies, I believe that with the support of people who tickle our faces with feathers with the utmost delicacy can help us perform the same type of muscular gymnastics.
