A_413 - Generally, experimenting on experimenters is extremely dangerous. There are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; ways of doing experiments to do certain scientific, psychological or philosophical analyses, and totally wrong methods (e.g. vivisection...). Experimentation is generally an important practice for making certain evaluations that are necessary to give further and better indications, and when a laboratory or company cannot or does not want to do it in a certain sense it &ldquo;does the job halfway&rdquo;. In some cases, even paying those who offer to act as a &ldquo;living test subject&rdquo; with prior consent is a further guarantee of not running into various types of problems.
