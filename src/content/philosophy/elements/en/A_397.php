A_397 - As far as seafaring is concerned, since cats are particularly fond of fish, it may be best to keep some of them on board, taking care to keep them only in certain rooms (with portholes if possible) and to ensure that the floors are sufficiently rough (BUT NOT dogs). Keeping potted plants on board can also be important, making sure that they are fixed correctly so that they do not tip over and remembering that they should NOT be watered with salt water (so perhaps cacti are the most suitable plants). As for those who work on boats or ships, I recommend maintaining a vegan or even better fruitarian diet, keeping all the vegetables they need in the storeroom. As for other philosophies that may be necessary, it is necessary to know that Scientology was actually founded by a person with experience in the Navy, and therefore much of what is needed philosophically by those who work in the Navy is found inside the &ldquo;philosophy box&rdquo; which is Scientology. However, I advise those who work on board NOT to follow philosophies relating to the Catholic Church, as they are more suitable for builders and engineers or in any case for those who live on land. Having said this, it may also be that Scientology is always suitable in various respects for those who are also involved in manufacturing airplanes, in being an airplane pilot, again in terms of what has been stated regarding the life experience of its founder and for the same reason I strongly advise against them for those who work in the agricultural sector.
