A_091 - As far as I'm concerned, the concept of an &ldquo;alien&rdquo; plant or species makes absolutely no sense to me. If a plant or a tree can grow and survive in an environment, then in my opinion it has a full right to live there, and the same goes for an animal. Aren't there people who are born in one place and then go to live on the other side of the world? Are we not trying to explore space and go and live on other planets even who knows how many light years away? And aren't we going to try to take potatoes or tomatoes with us and grow them on other planets as well? Since the answer is yes, then as far as I'm concerned it makes more sense to import lions to places where there are excess herbivorous animals rather than organizing hunting trips. Those who want to have fun shooting as far as I'm concerned can shoot rocks or play online shooters even in the company of teenagers. And then just to say, my mother has dozens of cacti. Do you really want to convince me that they are local species knowing that the Po valley was a swamp in the past? Do we really want to go and live on mars and not take ducks with us? In my opinion not.
