A_112 - Basically in life it is impossible to be able to do everything that we would like to do. As far as I'm concerned, there are many activities that I would like to do but that I can't do due to lack of time or resources. It is really important to know how to be satisfied and to know that we will be able to happily explore only a small slice of what we can experience overall by living.
