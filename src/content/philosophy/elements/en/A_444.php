A_444 - The &ldquo;dustlings&rdquo; are murals but made on the dust present on the windows. They have the characteristic of being difficult to photograph and can only be viewed in person, and furthermore also of being extremely easy to delete. Personally, however, I recommend not touching the dust with your hands but at least wearing a glove or using a paper tissue, as I had the impression that it was particularly harmful to direct touch (due to electromagnetic pollution).
