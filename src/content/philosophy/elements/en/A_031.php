A_031 - Personally, I don't even crush mosquitoes and I just use mosquito nets when they bother me too much and don't let me sleep. I noticed that in some cases they had some effects on me that I considered positive anyway, so anyway I decided to leave them alone. Warning: mosquitoes carry diseases and viruses that are sometimes very specific. After their first summer bites, I experienced strange discomfort in my bones (which then passed) and strange nervous tics in certain muscles (they also passed away). However I always consider it all training for the immune system.
