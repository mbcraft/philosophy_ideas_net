C_009 - Any product or service can be made more international by providing a QR code in which a page opens with a language selector, and then after selecting the language the desired information is provided to the customer. The language could possibly be detected automatically and selection allowed only upon express request, to be even more efficient. The information provided at that point can also be updated in real time.
