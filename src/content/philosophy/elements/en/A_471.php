A_471 - Being able to stay away from your partner, for work reasons, could be an optimal choice.

Choosing to be together with your partner even just on weekends could be, strange as it may seem, also a good way to be able to concentrate, have few distractions and avoid arguments. Smartworking could possibly be remodeled even just by working in a place close to your residence (such as dedicated hubs), but in any case for a company with its headquarters elsewhere.
