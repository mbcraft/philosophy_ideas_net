A_463 - In the family, instead of arguing, it can sometimes be useful to intelligently play mini jokes or mini sabotages. They are an excellent stimulus to improve coexistence and to avoid unpleasant discussions. The criterion for judging whether a prank is too heavy or not is the time it will take the person receiving the prank or sabotage to fix it. If it is less than a minute then we can be sure that our idea will be accepted and appreciated, if it involves tiring work instead then it will certainly be unwelcome.
