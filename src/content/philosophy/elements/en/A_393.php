A_393 - Within a more or less large territory, companies always form a slowly evolving ecosystem. Just as there are multi-utility companies and companies focused on a single type of product or service, there are also &ldquo;stop-gap&rdquo; companies that deal in some way with solving unknown problems or that in some way try to improve the performances of all the other companies (a bit like the oil in engines, which is responsible for keeping the engine sufficiently lubricated, or the cooling system). We must not make the mistake, for example, of thinking that a company that builds ships is useful and one that cuts or fixes toenails is not. Everyone is indispensable and no one is superfluous, regardless of their size.
