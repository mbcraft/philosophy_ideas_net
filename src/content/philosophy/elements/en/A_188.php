A_188 - It is not mandatory to &ldquo;follow your heart&rdquo; and your feelings. The heart with feelings is a binary option: you can use it, and then you live in a certain way, or you can not use it, and then you live in another way. If you use your heart, you are influenced by the community. If you don't use it, you are completely autonomous and safe from any emotional influence that affects your thoughts. In any case, even if a certain grayness remains in the heart in this case, one has access to other forms of knowledge and entertainment. However, usually if you get close enough to younger people of the opposite sex who are playing and joking, your heart tends to &ldquo;rekindle&rdquo; automatically.
