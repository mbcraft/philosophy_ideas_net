A_004 - Remember to leave some organic fertilizer for the trees in your garden and avoid pruning them unless they block the path. <br />
It is better not to leave the fruit to rot at the foot of the trees, it is better to collect it to feed it to animals rather than rot it. <br />
Not even unripe fruit should be left at the foot of the trees. Certain unripe fruits that are removed when fruit trees thin out can be used industrially to make other foods <br />
(For example, unripe plums should be great for making supplements as they contain a lot of minerals). <br />

<br />
Leaving the fruits or branches at the foot of the trees 'to rot' can be dangerous, especially if done on large farms. In some cases they can make the work more dangerous for the workers. <br />
Basically, the fruit still becomes available food for the insects that feed on it and the following years they come back to look for it and also attack the fruit attached to the trees and over time they can still become extremely problematic for farmers.
<br />
As for the rotting branches, in that case the microorganisms that attack them attack the dead wood that cannot be defended with the tree's immune system and therefore &ldquo;they learn to attack wood&rdquo;. <br />
Over time it is not certain that these pathogens that have &ldquo;trained&rdquo; with dead wood will not be able to attack living trees. <br /> This is why it would be better not to leave the branches of pruning on the ground on the farms.
