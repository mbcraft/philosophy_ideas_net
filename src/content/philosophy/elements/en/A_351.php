A_351 - Just as it happens for products that are shipped, which are cellophane-wrapped and boxed to ensure that they are shipped correctly and without damaging the product, the same can conceptually also happen for people. It is not forbidden to wear masks, particular clothes or costumes (even in your own home) in order to avoid certain situations or behaviors and encourage others. Wearing a very aesthetically ugly mask or smearing a bit of mud on your face, for some people, could still be a valid way to &ldquo;calibrate&rdquo; the human relationship with the people nearby. The same, conceptually, is done in reverse with make-up (which in reality, in itself, can go in different directions). The same, in reverse, can be done by wearing sunglasses with sufficiently strong lenses.
