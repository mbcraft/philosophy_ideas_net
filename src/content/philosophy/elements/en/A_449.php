A_449 - While for certain jobs we carry out we know what our profit will be (for example if a fee has been agreed upon contractually) it is not necessarily the case that for certain jobs, even carried out of our own free will or initiative, it is easy to understand the profit or advantages that will derive from it . Sometimes when we work following our common sense we don't always know in advance what the resulting benefit will be. It's normal for this to be the case. However, if we manage to decide to work on our own spontaneous initiative and not because someone forces us to do so, there are advantages from this too.
