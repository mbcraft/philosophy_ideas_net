A_639 - What we've lost with the use of smartphones is a sense of adventure. If we don't have our smartphones with us and we go on a short trip, our hearts will feel a sense of adventure, which naturally doesn't happen when we have a smartphone, as the uncertainties that trigger it within us are no longer there. With a smartphone, we can easily call a tow truck if we have car trouble, or emergency services if we need it, or someone we trust to ask for something we need. However, it's worth asking ourselves how much the feeling of being on an adventure compares to living a life always full of certainties.
