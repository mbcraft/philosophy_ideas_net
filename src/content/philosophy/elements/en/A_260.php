A_260 - Even pinball machines, conceptually, can be made with minerals, tillandsias or possibly even potted plants inside. Marbles can also be made from different metal alloys. Clearly it must be possible to open the glass to water the plants or possibly to replace them. Possibly, pinball machines, if they are connected to the internet, can also be used to have remote challenges with other players, or cooperative games.
