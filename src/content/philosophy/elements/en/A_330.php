A_330 - While I know it may seem strange or sound &ldquo;unpleasant&rdquo; to many men, it may not be a bad idea for women to have children with men other than the one they live with. In fact, finding DNA from people with very different ethnic groups or professions could be very useful in improving the overall condition of the family, in terms of total intelligence available to solve problems and work better. However, it is better to be clear and not hide anything from the man you live with, and still leave him the same opportunity. In any case, it is important that the children you have are looked after and treated correctly by the family that looks after them... and it is also equally important not to think from a &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; perspective, but only from a perspective of respect and better survival. In this case, however, I recommend putting references to the man who impregnated the woman in some way in the son's or daughter's surname.
