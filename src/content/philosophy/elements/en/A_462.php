A_462 - Personally, I advise everyone, always and in any case, to always leave AT LEAST one alms coin whenever possible to every person or place that requests it. It doesn't matter the value, even cents are fine if you have little money available. If you can leave even just one, it's not a problem and you shouldn't be ashamed even if you leave even just one coin of the lowest existing value (1 cent). That's fine too.
