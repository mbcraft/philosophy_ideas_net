A_061 - I personally strongly advise against masturbation, the use of condoms (except in case there are sexually transmitted diseases) and birth control pills. It's normal to be attracted to sexuality, because in itself it's an almost irresistible sensation that when it starts takes us into a state of &ldquo;autopilot&rdquo; until ejaculation. To learn to master sexuality it is important to know that any self-stimulation takes us from a state of calm to a higher level of excitement, and when the excitement reaches a sufficient level then it continues on its own until completion with ejaculation. However it is also important to know that any excitement and any sexual situation does not nourish us in any way and that no image of a person used with the purpose of exciting us can help us to improve our personal situation: it is only fiction.
