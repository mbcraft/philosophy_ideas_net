A_429 - In certain areas of the planet, the use of certain types of video games could be problematic or even harmful to health. In that case it is possible to resort to the support of psychologists, even with a monthly subscription, who will have to view the video games in your possession, know some of your personal information and follow you if necessary in order to protect you correctly. This can happen for the use of video games but also for other specific psychological support needs that may be necessary for particular categories of people (eg. to protect family health, work career, as support for travel to unknown places...). So, even if what I'm talking about in general may seem like a bonus from a psychological point of view (and it is in a certain sense) remember not to snub these professionals because other possibilities open up and develop, and this applies a little to all professions, always. If you need an expanded or more performing mind in certain circumstances you can also obtain it as a paid service from these professionals.
