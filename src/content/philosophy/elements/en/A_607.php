A_607 - It would be better not to store nuclear waste in depots and try to forget about it but to try to find other, better locations. Some ideas could be the following:
<ul>
	  <li>
  		Leave it in the Sahara so that it interacts with the sand, creating slight alterations. With all the space available, leaving them open would also be an excellent solution, as the wind then transports the slightly altered sand to the Amazon forest, and in that place it acts as a fertilizer, or even buried a few meters under the desert sand so that they remain there.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	In the crater of an inactive volcano
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	Used to create blocks to be used to test new types of chemical reactions, which occur in the presence of neutron emission from unstable waste
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  	Mixed with other substances to create new types of chemical substances that are unknown but are no longer radioactive. To achieve this goal, machinery could also be used to carry out chemical reactions in series with automatic mechanisms, in order to carry out multiple tests very quickly. Besides this it is not It is not even forbidden to use AI to try to understand if there are possibilities with some chemical substance. that we don't know about to exploit these chemical substances intelligently, so that from a problem they become a resource.

</ul>
