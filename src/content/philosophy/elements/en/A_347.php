A_347 - The repairability of particular &ldquo;faults&rdquo; or the possibility of solving certain problems (of various types) is not absolute but relative. Relating to the presence of sufficient resources of certain types. Hypothetically, if we erased all information relating to electronics from the planet (the specifications of the components and their function...), repairing a banal digital watch in a reasonable time would become essentially impossible. In addition to this, however, it is also important to say that sometimes what seems like a loss for a particular person that is impossible to heal or fill, with the right knowledge and some resources can be fixed, and that therefore essentially, the cost of the repair also varies depending on function of the knowledge available regarding the problem itself.
