A_602 - As regards silk, it must be said that the only correct production cycle that can be defined as truly ethical is the one that allows the silkworm to complete its gestation and transform into a butterfly, releasing itself into the open sky. At that point the silk from the cocoon can easily be used, and furthermore in this way no problems of any kind are created as the insect has been completely respected in any case. If the cocoons that are "dirtied" by the insect's exit are considered unusable, you can still think about washing them if necessary in order to make them usable again. In addition to this, the thread must subsequently be carded. Experiments can be done to understand how to overcome these problems, we can now do almost everything with chemistry, and it would be nice to let these insects complete their entire reproductive cycle and at the same time be able to use their silk for productive purposes. As far as mulberry trees are concerned, however, it is important that they receive organic fertilizer (from people, horses, cows, etc ...) so that they do not get too stressed in the continuous production of leaves intended for the silkworms.
