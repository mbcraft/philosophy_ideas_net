A_476 - The prolonged use of headphones to listen to music creates an interaction with our organism such that any metal or objects that squeak cause increased discomfort to the organism (e.g. fork on the plate). In addition to this, I also believe that the use of the internet to view remote places creates an interaction with our organism such that people tend to feel annoyed when they eat and we walk in front of them.
