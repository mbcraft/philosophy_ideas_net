A_201 - I don't know if you've ever heard the saying &ldquo;happiness is a muscle&rdquo;. As far as I'm concerned, I know that there is a muscle in the back that, if properly stimulated, produces a feeling of well-being that quickly rises from the base of the spine to the head. It is a gesture that can be done on command, knowing how to use that particular muscle. I learned this by accident while doing meditation. Personally, however, I rarely use it because in general I believe that it is something that happens spontaneously when necessary and in any case it does not necessarily have contraindications of which I am not aware...
