A_011 - If you have intestinal problems that are not acidity problems, a good juice of pink grapefruit on an empty stomach really works wonders. I have often used this method to sometimes fix some intestinal problems and it has worked really well. Some fruitarians believe that &ldquo;sour&rdquo; fruit should be avoided, but that is simply their mistake. Even acidic fruits have their reason and are not to be snubbed.
