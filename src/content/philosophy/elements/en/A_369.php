A_369 - It can be useful for students in classes to dedicate 2-3 minutes every morning to being silent, quiet, and simply breathing. If you succeed, you can carry out inhalations and exhalations of 5 seconds each, all starting at the same time, and possibly you can decide whether to breathe completely synchronized males and females (for example, everyone starts by inhaling) [1], or whether to alternate in a mirror-like way between males and females (i.e. while males inspire, females exhale and vice versa) [2], or whether to let everyone decide whether to start by inhaling or exhaling [3]. I recommend using these three types of synchronized breathing in rotation. It can also be used in other circumstances.
