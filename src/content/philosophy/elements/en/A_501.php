A_501 - If you happen to observe traditional fireworks, know that it is also possible to meditate while they are being used. A few moments after the explosion of the firework that lights up the night sky, the roar of the explosion reaches our ears: at that moment our consciousness contracts with fear and we can feel it inside our head. If we observe ourselves carefully in those moments it remains a useful exercise for our mind.
