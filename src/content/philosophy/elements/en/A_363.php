A_363 - Discernment is the ability to understand whether certain information is true and correct or not. However, the fact that false or problematic information exists does not mean that it should be destroyed: first of all, the important thing is that it is recognized as such and does not create confusion. Sometimes it can happen that within a text there are more or less serious errors (in syntax, grammar, but not only...). Just as scrap objects can somehow be dismantled and recycled, the same can also happen with texts that we consider problematic or waste.
