A_544 - People don't multitask, so having them work on many different projects in rotation is considered a big waste of resources for companies. Keeping those who work on a project on that project, on the contrary, allows it to be improved in the best and most efficient way possible. Many projects often &ldquo;die&rdquo; because those who built them are &ldquo;scrapped&rdquo; by their employers.
