A_605 - It is better for sexual relations to always remain calm and for the woman to always decide the way in which penetration occurs, and for her to still be left in control of the situation unless she decides otherwise. The important thing is that there is a joyful atmosphere. However, the reason is also scientific: while for men's injuries (sprains) the solution exists and works easily, I personally don't know equally easy solutions for women (in case of lacerations).
