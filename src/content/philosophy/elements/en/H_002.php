H_002 - In my spare time I have carried out experiments and research. This is what I have discovered over the years (roughly) ... in some cases I also included opinions or ideas that I could not test ... <br />
The strange sentences that are on the bottom of the men&ugrave; in the italian language of this internet site are just little poems made by me. They are a type of rhyme that I invented which consists of starting all the words with the same letter and creating sentences of complete meaning. Those poems are not translatable in other languages keeping intact the poem structure.
The concepts listed with the letter 'A...' and 'B...' are the result of the experience of a person who has lived almost always in the countryside, so they are also partly linked to that living environment. Those listed with 'B...' were part of a little booklet i printed in the past with which this work started of which i lost the source file. Those listed with 'C...' are opinions, while those listed with 'D...' are other informations.
I also wanted to remind you that some of these tips are quick and easy to use, while others are not at all or take a very long time: for example, after 20 years I still try to improve my nutrition. If you want to get an idea of what I consider &ldquo;medium difficulty&rdquo; eat an ivy leaf (be aware that it is very very stinging,if you decide to try it, taste a micropiece first).
Generally these concepts can also be used individually even if they represent my perception or my experiences and obviously contain information only on what I have understood and experienced. Having never had certain experiences (for example &ldquo;pilgrimage in the desert&rdquo; or &ldquo;sea cruise&rdquo;) obviously my descriptions and evaluations cannot take them into consideration too much. The same also applies to other certain types of resources that I couldn't afford (e.g. certain minerals, certain items, etc...).
