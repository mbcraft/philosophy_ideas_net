A_563 - If people raise chickens and profit in some way from their eggs, they surely cannot afford to hate snakes or not feed them if they are nearby. Snakes are not evil animals. While chickens don't scare people, but they ruin garden plants, snakes simply don't ruin plants but they scare people a little. And just as there are chickens of various colors, the same goes for snakes. This error is also present in the Harry Potter saga, in which the birds (Godric Gryffindor) are considered &ldpos;good&rdpos; and the (&ldpos;Salazar Slytherin&rdpos; translated as &ldpos;Green Serpents&rdpos; in Italian) are considered &ldpos;bad&rdpos;. It is wrong to psychologically bully snakes just because they scare us a little.
