A_158 - Anyone who for some reason is bound to practice chastity must still have other rights which could be for example that of being able to play (video games, board games, paper games) or to be able to receive love (not sexual intercourse) from people of the opposite sex without impediments. In general, however, it is appropriate that when some rights are absent, others are guaranteed.
