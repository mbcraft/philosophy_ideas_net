A_642 - It may be helpful to improve your health by gently stroking yourself in a cool, dry environment to stimulate the nerve connections in various parts of the body. It's also particularly important to caress between your fingers and toes, as these areas receive very little stimulation. You can use a cotton swab or a small brush to gently caress even those areas where your fingers struggle to be delicate and slender. It takes some time to become familiar with this method, and in some cases, you may feel some discomfort, but this goes away as you continue the massage. Note: This massage is useful for those who are generally healthy but have occasional mild discomfort, in which case it is particularly helpful. It certainly cannot resolve chronic health problems.
