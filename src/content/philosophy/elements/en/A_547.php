A_547 - &ldquo;The closing error&rdquo; is the error that occurs when the daily working hours end. If you do some activities made up of sub-parts, there is always a very high probability that the last activity you complete will have errors or be incomplete: it is absolutely normal for this to happen. It has happened to me too many times and I know that it is not my fault but a phenomenon that happens to everyone... or at least to all computer scientists.
