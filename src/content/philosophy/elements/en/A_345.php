A_345 - &ldquo;Tattoo recalibration&rdquo; is a psychological technique that consists of recalibrating the meanings associated with a tattoo (or parts of it when possible). You must analyze the tattoo on your body in its parts and re-associate the meanings you prefer to them. In this way it is possible to exploit it dynamically in different situations and for different purposes (probably both personal and work). If you decide to use this technique and in the past you have spread a meaning to third parties, refer to this portal and talk about &ldquo;tattoo recalibration&rdquo; to indicate that all the meanings you have mentioned in the past are no longer valid and that the only thing that you show to others is only the part drawn on the skin (let at least a week pass before using this technique). If you decide to use this technique I recommend dedicating at least 10 minutes to think about it calmly and if necessary take some notes to keep, for example in your wallet, on your decisions in this regard if you want to do it by yourself. You can also keep some &ldquo;cards&rdquo; with you and change the meaning you intend to use to your liking. You can also optionally combine non-permanent tattoos as an accessory to the permanent one if necessary, but remember that it is necessary to have the permanent one as a fixed reference and that its design must be clearly shown to people on social networks to work: the more the the larger the audience, the greater the intensity. Possibly, if you want to find more useful and intelligent meanings, you can ask for paid consultancy from third parties if they decide to offer this type of specific service (called &ldquo;tattoo recalibration consultancy&rdquo;). This technique cannot be used without the use of a permanent tattoo, and it is however important to remember that the power of the tattoo cannot be easily varied: few views, little intensity, many views, a lot of intensity. Publicly mentioning the use of tattoo recalibration can protect you from the effects of judgment that people may have associated with your tattoo.
