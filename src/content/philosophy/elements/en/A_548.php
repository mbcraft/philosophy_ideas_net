A_548 - There are some notions that I wanted to provide: the Italian translation of &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Come stai?&rdquo;, while &ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;Come va?&rdquo;. While &ldquo;how are you&rdquo; refers to the present psychophysical conditions, &ldquo;how are you doing&rdquo; refers to the latest events that have occurred in one's life, to the trend. In addition to this, it often happens (at least in Italy) that we hear people talking about &ldquo;light&rdquo; with the meaning of &ldquo;electricity&rdquo;, and talking about &ldquo;fresh bread&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;soft bread&rdquo;. Those interpretation errors or overlappings exists in other languages too.
