A_610 - As regards old clothes, there are various possibilities: we can use them to make rags (always useful for cleaning and dusting) or they could possibly be reused as scraps that could be used as fillers for other types of work (padded blankets, jackets padded) made for example by a tailor's shop rather than throwing them in the garbage. In the past, not much recycling of old fabrics has been done, however it is not excluded that in the future this type of processing will also become possible and it will be possible to recycle most of the cotton already used to make other fabrics. For example, simply, for a tailor's shop, wanting to make a more padded fabric and having scraps of old clothes available, it is sufficient to put a layer of fabric, some scraps in the middle correctly sized and positioned and then sew another layer of fabric on top.
