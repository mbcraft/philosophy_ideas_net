A_298 - I share the following gestures that can be used in every nation of the planet in which they are known by people both in working environments and interpersonal ones :
    <br />
<ul>
    <li>Finger over mouth, even smiling, while watching someone that is watching you --> Meaning : please, stop talking.</li>
    <li>Finger touching cheeks repeatedly while we look at someone that is looking at us --> Meaning : i would like a kiss from you on my cheek. (not in working environments?) </li>
    <li>One hand on the chest and the other in front --> Meaning : i need space, please leave me alone.</li>
</ul>
