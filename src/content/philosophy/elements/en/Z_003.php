Z_003 - Many African populations, due to the heat and drought, have developed a particular psychology, also because their original habits were those of being hunters and they have never been able to carry out great works of which we still have traces today due to the heat excessive and drought. It is necessary to understand that for many African populations self-sufficiency is impossible and therefore their behavior follows accordingly : unfortunately they know that they have death behind their back with the knife pointed at them. Historically it has unfortunately not been possible to build sufficient works to make them a little more self-sufficient from a water point of view and this has greatly influenced their behavior even in nations other than their own. However, it is important to understand that in a holistic and unitary vision of the planet even those areas must be made self-sufficient and productive in some way, that there are however varieties of fruit and vegetables that are suitable for growing in warmer climates including theirs and that they too are people who aim for well-being and therefore in general it is always better to invest in a direction that aims at long-term changes rather than thinking of "maintaining" people with food supplies (except in extraordinary cases, in my opinion), just as it is not necessarily the case that Europeans should keep lots of objects and trinkets that they could do without and which instead would be vital for those people, in order to make them feel better in their spare time without burdening their finances.
