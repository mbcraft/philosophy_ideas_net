A_063 - The best way to avoid embarrassing situations when walking down the street in the presence of other people is not to look at other people's erogenous zones. In some cities, even meeting the gaze of unknown people for more than a few seconds is considered a sort of affront. Probably the most respectful way to look at people when walking down the street is to look at their hair in case you want to focus on a detail, or to look at the person as a whole without dwelling on any particular part for no more than a handful of seconds.
