A_627 - Regarding the definition of "sin" in Christianity, it must be said that sin "is a sin". It is a sin because those who commit it are in fact wasting their lives in useless gestures that will make them waste their time. When we speak of sins in relation to certain gestures, we are essentially speaking of wastes of time by individuals who make unintelligent gestures and thus waste their resources. This is the explanation I give myself, behind sin there is always and in any case hidden stupidity, the fact that sin was spoken of in ancient times is due to the lack of philosophy and science to explain exactly why certain behaviors are considered stupid, or maybe that word was chosen precisely for the meaning I gave it.
