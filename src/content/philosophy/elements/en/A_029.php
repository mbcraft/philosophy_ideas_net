A_029 - If you have dogs you probably know that when you eat they want to eat too. Personally I always try to leave the dogs samples of what I eat or even just to let them smell what I know they wouldn't eat (for example olives). This is because treating your pets well by helping them understand what we eat helps improve the feeling with them. Some foods have miraculous effects in terms of feeling for dogs, such as dried fruit in general (e.g. hazelnuts) which, however, I allow very sporadically. This obviously &ldquo;in addition&rdquo; to their normal nutrition.
