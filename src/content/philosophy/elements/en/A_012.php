A_012 - As for the wool, I think it can be used, but the sheep should be sheared with razors with a built-in comb so that they are not shaved completely and are not injured by the razor during shaving. Furthermore, sheep should only be shorn in the middle of spring. In this way they would have short hair in the hottest period of the year and long in the coldest one. It must also be said that it is perfectly understandable that a shepherd who raises and manages sheep basically has a very difficult problem to manage: that of animal reproduction. Any animal that finds food in abundance and is close to its own kind tends to reproduce (this applies to poultry, sheep, etc ...) and it is therefore understandable that those who manage these animals find themselves having to steal the eggs from the nests or produce cheese (with all the unpleasant &ldquo;practices&rdquo;) that many vegans are aware of in order to block the continuous reproduction of animals. So I personally invite all vegans not to have any hostility towards this type of activity, and indeed, if they have any better solutions, I invite them to propose them.
