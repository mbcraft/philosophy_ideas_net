A_494 - I believe that it is important for disabled people to also be able to use wheelchairs that only work when pushed manually by an operator. Although tiring, the fact that an electric motor is always running when the person in a wheelchair moves creates some psychological alterations that cannot be fixed except with this system. I'm reasonably sure that this type of vehicle makes disabled people think with a different perspective. Especially you are in a big city.
