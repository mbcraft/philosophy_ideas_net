A_247 - It is necessary to clean desktop computers from dust at least annually, and it is very likely that laptops also require periodic cleaning of at least the keyboard. Even keyboards (mechanical ones) can almost always be cleaned by unscrewing the screws and washing the parts that can be washed with soap and water. I have already performed this procedure once on mine and it worked perfectly. This helps make them last longer.
