A_129 - In general, regarding the friends with whom you go out to be together, there is a clarification to be made. People, for some reason, are led to think that friends should help us for free. Well, this concept is wrong. Benefits are always the result of work, and work always costs effort, therefore it is wrong to think that when you are with friends you should feel good for free: it must be an exchange. We must think that everyone in the group does their part, with their skills and commitment and that we too must do the same thing and contribute with equal value, otherwise there will be arguments and misunderstandings.
