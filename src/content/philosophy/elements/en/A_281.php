A_281 - When you have pain (for example from having bumped into something) if you have a cat among your pets it is possible to calm the sensation of pain a little by petting the cat a little and holding it on top of you, anesthetizing the pain. It is not a real healing, but only a process of &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; anesthesia. In any case it lasts for a limited time of a few hours.
