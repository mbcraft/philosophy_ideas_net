A_016 - As for tillandsias, I believe that in addition to the appropriate diluted NPK fertilizer, in general they can be fertilized by our breath and by the smells that our body or that of animals emits. I also know that they grow in places with strong electromagnetic waves, so I think it can be very smart to keep them in taxis, buses, subways, trains, planes, shopping malls and offices. It might also be a good idea to place some minerals near these plants as well.
