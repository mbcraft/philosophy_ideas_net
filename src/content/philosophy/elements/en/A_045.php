A_045 - The mobile phone should never be kept in your pocket, this tends to be because; it is easy to go out, fall on the ground and break. It should only be kept: either in the hand while we use it, or leaning against a perfectly horizontal surface such as a table or bed, or possibly kept inside bags or purses. But not in the pockets.
