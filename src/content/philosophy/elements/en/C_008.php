C_008 - Companies that have problems with the fumes from their chimneys can alternatively seek a solution with zero emissions into the atmosphere by passing the fumes into a tank of water... in this way they are trapped in the water and it can then be managed differently, possibly by companies that can actually deal with them by transforming them into other products or managing them so that they are no longer a problem.
