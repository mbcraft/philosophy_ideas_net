A_403 - As regards the Kama Sutra, the correct use consists in trying out all the positions illustrated in it with your partner (or even as simple psychological training, choosing a person of the opposite sex willing to also act as a teacher) WITHOUT doing no penetration (or in any case always BEFORE actual sexual intercourse, if you do it with your partner). This allows you to become familiar and develop drastically on a psychological level. Naturally it is important that there is no disturbance or hindrance from other people. However, it is important to have a certain psychological attitude otherwise it is not easy, but I can assure you that it is very important. It could also be done in gyms, without problems. To calibrate the activity you can use overalls (even dark coloured), anti-covid masks, masks, etc... clearly you need to avoid ejaculations from happening when doing this type of exercise, keeping in mind that they could happen anyway... NOTE: conceptually these exercises, in gyms, could also be practiced by people who have taken a vow of chastity...
