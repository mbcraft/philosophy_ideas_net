A_352 - In both personal and working relationships, being active or passive involves different ways of reasoning and operating. In general, what matters is to agree on one's role (active, passive, fluctuating, active only in certain roles...) avoiding forms of coercion and understanding that in case of excessive discontent these methods must obviously be renegotiated. While on the one hand certain people might like &ldquo;object&rdquo; people (i.e. those who do not make certain or no decisions and who live in obedience or as a sort of living ornament) that is, what is important to remember is that in any case we must not behave like parasites and that we must be collective satisfaction. Even people with a passive role are important and should still be respected. However, there are excesses in both activity (aggression, tiredness) and passivity (laziness, boredom) that should be avoided. For example, those who have an &ldquo;active&rdquo; role are usually slower in carrying out tasks because they have to spend time understanding how to behave and which direction to take at a decision-making level, while those who are passive and do not have to decide anything can become extremely faster in what he does, because he doesn't have to worry about anything else. In any case, if there are some of the problems I have described, renegotiating the roles can be decisive.
