A_282 - It is particularly important to go to dinner not too tired, and if necessary it is advisable to rest a little before having dinner (at least half an hour, lying in bed), so as not to have dinner too tired. Better, in this case, postpone dinner but still rest for that half hour. This is because if you go to dinner too tired, the digestive process that begins after dinner, due to too much tiredness, causes a complete collapse of your attention and completely ruins the next phase of the day, which instead, for example, can be used for other activities.
