A_073 - Basil pesto is a condiment typically paired with pasta loved by millions of people. But what almost no one knows is that basil is actually mildly toxic. If, for example, when you season pasta you overdo it with basil pesto (I use the vegan one) for several days in a row, what happens is that the heart is &ldquo;reset&rdquo;. In the digestion phase we begin to feel a strong sensation of greyness, monotony and absence of feelings, almost as if we had gray concrete inside our heart. It is not a permanent condition, over time the body tends to purify itself and we return to that condition in which the heart makes us perceive that &ldquo;warmth&rdquo; that we typically associate with the love that others feel towards us. I don't deny that when you find yourself in that condition of greyness and monotony everything is extremely more difficult and mentally tiring, but it is equally true that when we are in that state we also make very different and &ldquo;differently intelligent&rdquo; reasoning.
