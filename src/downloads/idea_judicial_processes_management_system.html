		<h2>Idea for an improved system for managing judicial processes - Version 1.2</h2>
		Thinking about the fact that there are many judicial processes waiting to be carried out even just with regards to the Bologna prosecutor's office (I think there were around 21,000 at the time of initial writing of this text) and how this problem could be resolved, I conceived this system . I thought about it a bit and evaluated some solutions that came to mind. The best one I could think of is this: create a sort of "virtual" process management. All the data of all the processes are uploaded into a dedicated portal (so if the documentation is on paper it all needs to be scanned and should be digitised) and uploaded to this portal. Then lawyers should register to participate by specifying their skills and personal data as well as the contact details for making payments. At that point the portal, with an algorithm, creates virtual courts: the lawyers of both sides are assigned in an almost random way (one or more depending on the amount of documentation that is part of the case and also based on the skills of the lawyers, and based on the budget defined by the companies involved in the process) and the same goes for the jury, competent lawyers are appointed, generally with more years of experience. The people obviously do not know each other and the use of nicknames favors professional procedural management. This whole process creates virtual classrooms using for example a tool like Slack (a work space for each trial where there are mainly 5 rooms: 'prosecution client lawyers', 'defense client lawyers', 'lawyers common space', 'trial hearings ' and 'general communications' ), in which people can debate by writing, exchange material of all kinds and, if necessary, also hold video conferences. Obviously the relevant lawyers involved in the process can only access the rooms to which they are entitled, always established by the algorithm based on common sense. So the virtual courts portal, in addition to creating these virtual spaces for managing trials, also manages wages, the contract with which lawyers are hired to manage trials, timing and rules. In my opinion, this approach would be truly optimal, because:
		<ul>
		  <li>ensures management by people competent in the matter</li>
		  <li>protects lawyer workers by allowing smart working</li>
		  <li>gives work to people who may be in difficulty</li>
		  <li>Effectively resolves trials and disputes</li>
		  <li>It's extremely fast</li>
		  <li>has negligible costs for the nation</li>
		  <li>protects the health of lawyers from possible retaliation, just use nicknames</li>
		  <li>effectively eliminates the possibility of bribing the lawyers or the jury</li>
		  <li>effectively guarantees justice regardless of the amount of litigation and disastrous events (such as the fire that occurred in the Milan prosecutor's office)</li>
		  <li>allows the execution of processes even in times of pandemic, protecting any type of choice regarding vaccination</li>
	  	  <li>allows the easier evolution of the judicial system carried out through analysis of processes and their outcomes</li>
	  	</ul>
	  	As regards the management of the portal, operators should be responsible for disbursing payments to lawyers and managing the money arriving from companies and distributing it to lawyers based on what is established by the algorithms, as well as carrying out routine checks to check that the system functions regularly. In addition to this, they should remain available to lawyers for any needs or to collect feedback on further implementations to improve the system.
	  	I can understand that reforms would perhaps be needed to make this system legal but given that there are exceptional circumstances and what I wrote seems very reasonable to me, and also given that there were mafia who set fire to the Milan prosecutor's office... not I see why it can't be done... this is just a draft of the idea but in any case there should be approximately 80% of the necessary information... any missing details can be decided with a little common sense... However, the basic concept is to use virtual courts to parallelize the management of trials...
