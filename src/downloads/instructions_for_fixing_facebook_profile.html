		After doing login in Facebook web app, copy and paste the following link in the browser internet address bar :<br />
		<br />
		<b>https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=profile_and_tagging&setting_id=timeline_can_post</b><br />
		<br />
		In the first configuration on top (Who can publish contents in your profile) select "Only me". This will stop other people that are faking friendship to publish unwanted posts on your profile.<br />
		<br />
		Then open the following page :<br />
		<br />
		<b>Settings and privacy > Activity registry > Post</b><br />
		<br />
		In that menu there are two sub-menus available :<br />
		<br />	
		- <b>Post and comments in which you're tagged</b><br />
		<br />
		and<br />
		<br />
		- <b>Photos and videos in which you're tagged</b><br />
		<br />
		On both of these pages it is possible to delete all extraneous posts, usually regarding slimming products or sexual content, typically aimed at causing emotional distress in women for coercive purposes.
		<br />
		<br />
		After that you should briefly check your friend list and block, report to Facebook and remove all the people that you don't recognize as the ones you added.
