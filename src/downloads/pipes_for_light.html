		<h1>Pipes for light : an idea for agricolture in places with very few sunlight - version 1.1</h1>
		
		Some time ago I theorized the possibility of building a system of glass pipes to channel light in places where it is abundant and very strong (such as the Sahara) and transporting it via glass pipes to places where it is scarce or not strong enough (let's suppose for example Poland), for uses intended for example for agriculture. For example, with a series of mirrors the light could be concentrated in a very small circumference, channeled through these glass pipes (which could also be underground) and transported thousands of kilometers without dispersion to where it could be used. Again through a series of mirrors and optical mechanisms, the flow could be sorted and regulated. Another potentially usable transmission method could be that of a laser bridge to carry out line-of-sight transmission, although it would potentially be more dispersive and more dangerous, although certainly less expensive and laborious, but still indispensable if one wanted to forward the transmission of light to other continents or to islands completely detached from the African continent (think of the American continent or Japan, for example). In any case, sand is abundant in the Sahara, so making glass pipes shouldn't be that expensive, considering that again using the sun and Fresnel lenses it is possible to melt the sand on site and transform it into glass with very little cost. This project, in addition to improving agricultural yields in places where the sun is scarcely available, opens up a very wide range of scenarios and could potentially also largely replace the use of gas in many areas and allow for savings in resources extremely significant for energy production (for example even for heating water for domestic usage).
