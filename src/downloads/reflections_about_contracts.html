		<h1>Reflections about contracts : version 1.0</h1>
		
		As far as contracts are concerned, in my opinion it would be useful if the contracts were standardized by product/service sector and if each contract also had a concise version that could be shown to the customer in order to make him/her understand immediately what are the key points he/she must respect for the use of a particular product/service. I have seen companies that have listed the key points to be respected in a single page, and in that way the buyer will surely be able to find the time to read all the terms and conditions as it only takes a few minutes, but I have also seen companies proposing contracts of 40 pages or more, sincerely unmanageable by anyone who simply wants to buy a product/service. With standardization, discussions could also be created in order to actually understand what is right to include in a contract and what is not right, for the purpose of protecting the work of companies. It would ultimately make people's lives easier, and that doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. In any case, the &ldquo;no contract&rdquo; option is undoubtedly valid for some types of products/services.
