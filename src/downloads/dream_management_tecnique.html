		<h2>Come back home from darkness - Version 1.0</h2>
		<br />
		This technique to practice during sleep is quite complex, it is a sort of exercise that can be done when you are half asleep. When we are half asleep and, with our eyes closed, we dream of being somewhere, the exercise to do is the following: keeping our eyes closed, remember that we are sleeping, and, wherever and whatever situation we are dreaming of, mentally return to the where you are, i.e. the bedroom, and think, always keeping your eyes closed, about your position within the bedroom. It is absolutely not easy, as, while we dream, the situation we are dreaming about can be extremely distant and difficult to manage. It's a sort of real &ldquo;escape&rdquo; from the dream. The exercise essentially involves becoming aware enough to be able to &ldquo;go home&rdquo; to the darkness of your dream. At that point, if you open your eyes and you are actually in the position and place that you had managed to think of a few moments before, with your eyes closed, then it means that you have managed to correctly &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the dream.
