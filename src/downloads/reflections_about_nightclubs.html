		<h1>Reflections about nightclubs : version 1.0</h1>
		
		In my opinion it doesn't make sense that in discos there is very loud music because people can't talk and get to know each other. You can dance even with much lower volume music, and in that way boys and girls would have the opportunity to socialize and get to know each other, instead of getting high on alcohol and loud music. It would seem to me a much smarter management.
