		<h2>Concept of a floating bridge</h2>
		Thinking about the project for the bridge over the Strait of Messina mentioned by the government and knowing (as local inhabitants) that its construction is still very problematic (just think of what has already happened with the existing infrastructures which have never been completed as well as the fact that it appears to me that there are somewhat hostile conditions for the construction of a bridge on a hydrogeological level, at least according to what I was told by a Sicilian friend) I thought that a floating bridge could be built instead. In broad terms it is not easy for me to explain it, but I will try: the bridge should be built not by looking for the shortest connection between the two terrestrial ends, but instead by following a linear path more suited to reducing the lateral resistance to the sea current as much as possible. This is because if vehicles have to pass, it is important that the bridge does not suffer too problematic lateral thrusts.<br />
		<br /><br />
		In addition to this, always to reduce resistance to sea waves, the floating "islands" which in some way constitute the joints of the bridge and connected to each other to allow the transit of land vehicles (but not railways) should have in the immersed part and floating panels oriented (and possibly also "orientable") so as to counteract the sea current and modify the resistance to the sea current based on its strength, with the same principle with which sailing boats use the wind to navigate in the sea: exploiting the thrust of the sea current, the bridge should remain in a straight line as much as possible using these controllable oriented panels.<br />
		<br />
		In addition to this, it would also be possible to ensure that the bridge can be installed and uninstalled, let me explain: using a sort of storage (dock) with motors and pulleys in the coast and placing two mobile bridges in the initial and terminal part of the bridge that hook and unhook to the initial and final "islands" that support the road, it is conceptually possible to install and uninstall the bridge, i.e. to allow the transit of vehicles when the bridge is installed and instead allow the transit of ships when the bridge is not installed (and is put back into storage, or "dock"). In this case, however, it is useful to understand that the bridge is not divided in half, but a single large sequence of floating islands, and that when it is uninstalled, it is released from the terminal part (the calculation of which depends on the sea current but which I believe always has the same direction) and positioned entirely inside the depot, which should be left alongside the coast.<br />
		<br />
		Perhaps it's a bridge concept quite similar to one the military might use, assuming the military isn't already using bridges that function similarly.<br />
		<br /><br />
		As regards the submerged part of the "islands", if voluminous and very light materials are used conceptually this should be more than sufficient to make the islands floating and capable of supporting even larger cars or vehicles (which ferries already do ).<br />
		<br /><br />
		In addition to this, if in some way the "islands" have adjustable panels, it goes without saying that they are connected to each other with electrical cables, which have the motors necessary to orient the panels, which have sensors to measure the intensity of the sea current and also the necessary data cables and equipment to transmit information to the control center that pilots and manages the bridge.<br />
		<br /><br />
		If it is done in this way you must also keep in mind the maintenance part, understand that there could be faults with the sensors, the electrical components, and that there could also be any cleaning operations (for example from algae) that need to be carried out.<br />
		<br /><br />
		Building this type of bridge by engineering companies allows it to be used in areas where it is difficult to build, as well as actually allowing its sale and construction also to companies that do not operate on site to carry out work with cement but that they simply take care of assembling it and building only the minimum part necessary to maintain the dock and make it work via network connection, unlike what would happen with a traditional bridge which instead requires large concrete pillars, major work even underwater , etc ...
