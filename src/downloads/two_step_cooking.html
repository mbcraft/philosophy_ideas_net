	<h1>Two-step cooking - Version 1.1</h1>
	This cooking technique was born by chance when in the house where I live I felt the need to try my hand at culinary experiments without being able to use pots or pans. <br />
	It essentially involves taking an already cooked basic dish and starting from it adding other ingredients until you get to the finished dish. As basic ingredients you can use previously cooked dishes or even ready-made foods in jars or cans from supermarkets. <br />
	The remaining part is usually made up of spices, small vegetables or jarred or canned products to be used to create combinations.<br />
	In this way it is possible to give vent to your culinary creativity even without using pots or stoves.<br />
	As a basic dish to start with, you can start with just about anything, but typically it's easy to start with cooked pasta, steamed potatoes, sliced tomatoes, cooked beans, etc. and it can be freshly prepared or even cold.<br />
	The second part is made up of ingredients that must be added to the basic dish to create the flavor we want to experience.<br />
	For example, if the basic dish is cooked pasta, it is perfectly understandable that you can add, for example, 100% vegetable pesto with basil. However, it is rare for other ingredients to be added after having put this ready product in, but nothing prevents you from doing so.<br /> For example, after adding the basil pesto to the pasta dish, you can easily add some spicy chilli pepper, or otherwise some oregano. Both are two very tasty combinations. <br />
	As regards boiled potatoes, for example, an example combination could be to put seed oil, salt and curry, or another combination could be to put vinegar and capers.<br />
	These are just examples of preparations that are made cold and which do not require the use of the stove but which can enormously enrich the flavors of what you eat. <br />
	This cooking method is particularly suitable for those who cannot get involved in the kitchen but want to have fun experimenting with new flavours. It should also be remembered that nothing prevents you from seasoning fruit with salt or vegetables with sugar, or even using spices together, always to experiment with new flavors.
