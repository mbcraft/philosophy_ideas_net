		<h1>Artificial shadow clouds - Concept</h1>
		This concept describes the possibility of creating artificial cloud shadows. These clouds are used to have artificial shade in any sufficiently sunny place reachable by vehicle and also to be able to obtain electricity that can be used to carry out work and facilitate the work of the workers. Their aim is to facilitate the implementation of major works (for the creation of roads, aqueducts, but not only...) in highly sunny places where otherwise it would not be possible due to excessively high temperatures.<br />
		The artificial cloud is created as follows: a large air chamber containing helium constitutes the central body of the cloud, and this generally tends to lead to the cloud as a whole having a weight slightly lower than 0, as a anchoring to the ground via a cable connected to a heavy trolley equipped with wheels, to prevent a strong wind from moving the cloud away, and as a support for the manual control panel and other parts of this object.<br />
		The cloud, at the top, should have solar panels that are used to produce electricity. In addition to this it should have fans, sensors and a control system necessary to ensure that it is somehow balanced and maintains a horizontal position and a certain altitude. The electric current produced, if more than that necessary for stabilisation, can be stored in a battery and the trolley with control panel, in addition to allowing the installation and re-housing of the deflated shadow cloud in the trolley, also provides sockets power supply, to connect any work tools, or phone chargers...<br />
		The electric cable that connects the artificial shadow cloud to the control trolley must be able to be rewound or stretched as desired, so that the height of the cloud can be decided. As regards the structure of the cloud, if it were designed with criteria that recall the concept of origami, and it were possible to carry out &ldquo;folding&rdquo;, this could be the correct way to achieve it as it would then be possible to have extremely large clouds, which they produce enough electric current, and at the same time they can be put back &ldquo;to rest&rdquo; in an orderly manner in compact spaces. As regards inflation and deflation, this should take place with the cloud close to the ground, using a special tube to be attached, both for the inflation and deflation phases.<br />
		The trolley should also contain a helium cylinder with the relative pump which allows you to put the cloud into operation, or to keep it inside the trolley for transport after having deflated it, keeping all the helium in the cylinder present in the trolley. A space dedicated to modules would also be useful in the cart. They would have the function of serving different purposes: a storage module in which to store any objects &ldquo;typically used&rdquo; together with the artificial cloud or useful to workers (such as detergents, food, personal effects), or for example am/fm radio modules or music players, or refrigerator modules for storing drinks or even modules to be used as baskets for any rubbish that could be produced during work (cigarette butts, empty drink bottles, used handkerchiefs or napkins, snack remnants of workers ...), or even modules with other tools necessary for workers... just to give some examples...<br />
		I realize that it is not a simple invention to implement, but I believe that it is absolutely feasible (there are stations orbiting around the earth!!).<br />
		Note: for this type of idea, I think it is better to imagine a large and wide trolley rather than something compact, because it is better to have empty spaces in the slots for the needs that may exist than to be sacrificed. This does not mean that this type of trolley cannot be compatible with trailers to be attached to motorized vehicles (e.g. large-engined cars) to allow their transport, and in certain cases also be powered by them for some special needs (inflation/deflation ) from these vehicles.
