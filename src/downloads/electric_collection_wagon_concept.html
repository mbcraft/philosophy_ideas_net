		<h3>Concept for an electric collection wagon</h3>
		As regards the harvesting wagons used in orchards, the diesel ones have the disadvantage that they are very noisy (and therefore the workers who are on top of the wagon are hardly able to converse or listen to music), they have the engine that runs idle (and therefore consumes fuel unnecessarily) and ejects fumes which is often harmful to workers.<br />
		For this particular type of operation, an electric collection truck, however, would have the following advantages:
		<ul>
		<li>The electric motor could deliver only the necessary power, avoiding any waste of energy (compared to the diesel version) and would not need to idle. In addition to this, being silent, it would not cause any acoustic nuisance to the workers, and in addition to this, having no exhaust fumes it would not intoxicate the workers at work.</li>
		<li>By placing covers in the upper part with photovoltaic panels, in addition to providing shade for the workers, it could be possible to recharge the battery by taking advantage of the sun, which is often abundant during harvest periods.</li>
		<li>Not having the noise of the internal combustion engine, even an am/fm radio or a music player could be installed in the collection wagon, to cheer up the workers during work, or even possibly fans, to improve air conditioning during work .</li>
		</ul>
		The electric collection wagon would obviously require a battery to be used as a power supply and the possibility of being recharged at night from a standard electrical socket.<br />
		As regards the loading and unloading of containers, the lift normally operating with pressurized oil could be created using gears. By connecting a toothed wheel to a toothed bar and locked in the vertical movement and managing the power applied to the gears, it is also conceptually possible to create the lift.
