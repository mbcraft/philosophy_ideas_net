		<h2>Tool for combing snow-covered trees</h2>
		It would be conceptually possible to create a tool for combing snow-covered trees that could be attached to a 4-wheel motorized vehicle suitable for crossing forests. The methods of realization can be different, but essentially it should be an object that rises upwards, or using a special propeller protected inside a tube, so that it can remain high but without being ruined by the presence of branches, or even using some type of balloon inflated with helium so that it remains at a certain height. Laterally it should somehow contribute to moving the nearby branches, so possibly you could use the flow of air entering from the propeller above to get some lateral air, or even just use protuberances that help touch the snow-covered branches. The lower part would be attached to a motorized vehicle and powered electrically, so that it follows it during its journey through the forest and since the motorized vehicle would be in front, there would be no danger of falling snow for those who drive it. As regards any snow that could fall inside the pipe with the propeller, a sort of trap door could possibly be provided in the lower part which can also be opened and closed automatically based on the presence of weight inside, so to dump the snow immediately if it ends up inside the equipment. Alternatively, you can think of using a light object filled with helium so that it tends to remain upwards and dragging it with the motorized vehicle into the forest, so that it causes the snow to fall from the branches it comes into contact with. thanks to the lateral protuberances. As already described elsewhere it is important to remove the snow from the branches as it prevents sunlight from reaching the needle-like leaves and it also continually weighs on the tree.
