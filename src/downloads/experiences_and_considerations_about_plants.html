	<h2>Experiences and considerations about plants</h2>
	Beyond interesting discoveries such as those told in the book &ldquo;music makes tomatoes grow&rdquo; I also decided to share some of my experiences with plants and specifically trees. Trying to light a cigarette and make it burn by blowing on it outdoors near a tree, I mentally tried to &ldquo;illustrate&rdquo; to the tree what that phenomenon was, in particular the concept of fire, knowing that for him it would not have been pleasant (because fire also burns trees), thinking something like &ldquo;here, see? this is fire, I know it's dangerous for you, I just wanted to show you... don't worry...&rdquo;. What happened is the following night I had a microscopic sized nightmare. I was shown something extremely small (about the size of a cigarette tip...) but incredibly scary and terrifying. So the interesting phenomenon that occurred is this: the tree responded to the environmental stimuli that I created by showing me something equivalent for me. It is also for this reason that I am not in favor of unjustified pruning: I noticed precisely that they had the effect of filling me with fatigue and tiredness within a few days, almost as if those cut branches also served to support the weight of what I was doing and failing them I should only feel worse. I also tried gravity, using metal spheres bought in Chinese shops (the ones used to massage the hands, with the rattle inside) repeatedly throwing them up near trees and mentally remaining &ldquo;open&rdquo; to the fact that they were watching. Also in that case, within a short time I witnessed an unknown phenomenon (it happened to me, however, while I was watching a video) which left me quite amazed but which I cannot describe. In any case, even in that circumstance, however, within a short time I received feedback, so I interpreted this feedback also connected to the environmental stimulus I had performed. As a result of these experiences, I have mentally developed the thought that there is nothing as serious as fires in our arboreal heritage. That miniature nightmare made me even vaguely imagine what the incredible terror these beings feel in the presence of flames that burn them.
