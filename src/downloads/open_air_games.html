	<h2>Open air games - Version 1.2</h2>
	<h3>The launch of the 'C's</h3>
	After having built special metal circles with padding and cutting a part of the circumference of an appropriate length (therefore creating a sort of 'C') it is possible to throw them towards trees in a similar way to how you do with the freesbee and you score a point every time the 'C' fits correctly into the trunk of the tree.
	<h3>Basket attached to trees</h3>
	It is possible to build metal baskets so that they hook onto trees and remain blocked using springs (so as to exert pressure on the trunk but not prevent the growth of the tree) and play by throwing the ball into the basket in a similar way to what It's done with basketball, although obviously since there isn't a &ldquo;backboard&rdquo; near the basket the way in which you have to shoot the ball changes. The difference compared to classic basketball is that in this way even the trees probably have fun.
	<h3>Target shooting</h3>
	By creating an object with metal that attaches to a trunk and blocked with springs (so that it does not impede the growth of the tree) and placing large numbered &ldquo;strips&rdquo; on both sides of the attachment that move away from the attachment (for example 2 stripes on the left and 2 on the right, with a shape that resembles an . For example, suppose there is a sequence &ldquo;3-1-4-2-1-1-3-2&rdquo; then participants will have to try to shoot at the corresponding targets following the order. The first player to hit all the targets in the pre-established sequence wins. The participants try to make the correct sequence of shots in sequence, and when one participant makes a mistake they move on to the next one. The shots are taken from a pre-established point for all participants. When a participant tries to carry out the sequence, another participant in rotation has the obligation to check it and interrupt him in case of an error. Possibly another pre-established rotating player who is not throwing the ball could be allowed to disturb whoever is playing who has to throw the ball by optionally saying out loud any number of his choice only once.
	<h3>Marble runs with plant seeds inside to play on the beach</h3>
	It is possible to use plastic marbles that can be opened, filled with seeds of various plants and then closed and used to play on tracks made on the sand of the beaches. The important thing is obviously to be able to use those seeds to grow plants.
	<h3>Dynamic Orienteering</h3>
	Dynamic orienteering is orienteering with some improvements. Before departure, the participating boy or girl chooses a costume to wear from a wardrobe that is available to them and a candy of their choice from a basket. The candy must be kept in the mouth for the entire duration of the route and must reach the finish line without being chewed: it must be shown on the tongue to the jury upon arrival. Attached to the trees along the route there are transparent envelopes with QR codes printed inside. The participating boy or girl, using a smartphone that they will carry with them during the race provided by the organizer of the competition, scans the QR code and receives instructions on how to complete the next segment of the route (up to the next tree). For example, a method could be &ldquo;jump on the right leg&rdquo; or &ldquo;hold one hand over the left eye&rdquo; or &ldquo;advance doing pirouettes&rdquo; or &ldquo;keep both hands behind your back&rdquo; or &ldquo;keep both hands on knees&rdquo;, etc ... however, it must be kept in mind that some of these methods are extremely cruel towards those who follow the route and therefore must be managed and used with care.
	<h3>Jumping the rope attached to the tree</h3>
	The classic game of rope skipping in which two side participants rotate a rope and the person in the middle jumps can also be done by tying one end of the rope to a tree and using only one participant to rotate the rope.
	<h3>Throwing of the caps</h3>
	Using a medium-sized plastic flower vase as a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; and metal caps typical of food jars, it is possible to play by challenging friends by throwing the caps like small &ldquo;freesbees&rdquo; and trying to throw the caps into the basket.
	<h3>Pine cone crasher</h3>
	A line is drawn 5 meters from a wall and pine cones from which all the seeds have been previously removed are kept available. The game consists of throwing the pine cones against the wall with as much force as possible, staying behind the line. The more parts of the pine cone detach (the fins) from hitting the wall, the more points you score. Each flap that comes off is worth 1 point. After each throw you have to collect all the flaps that have come loose and each of these is counted as 1 point. Each participant has the same number of pine cones available, and everyone throws their pine cones. It is permitted to crush the pine cone with just one hand, but if some fins come off, each fin that comes off is 6 penalty points. Even throwing must be done with one hand. Before the start of the game, it is also established how many total throws can be made in a reasonable number. Participants, if they want, can discard the pine cone they are using and move on to the next one. A discarded pine cone can no longer be used for throwing at that point, so players must understand how long to continue throwing the same pine cone and when to move on to the next one. For example, it could be established that each participant has 6 pine cones available, and a total of 25 throws. To play with it you need large, spherical pine cones, some types of pine cones are not suitable.

	If possible, I advise active participants in the games to at least leave their urine near a tree.
