		<h1>Idea for standardized food delivery service</h1>
		Nowadays, numerous restaurants, takeaways and other types of companies that produce ready-to-eat foods offer home delivery of food. The problem, however, is that for those who carry out the deliveries it is a terrible, risky job, and which probably has very serious effects on their personal life as they are often also poorly paid, and this in turn also leads to tensions and frictions with those who manages. At the same time, it is also true that it would be unmanageable if every single person had to go to the restaurant or takeaway to pick up the food purchased to consume in their own home.<br />
		<br />
		There is a solution to this: the creation of an intermediate service that only deals with home food deliveries, but not for a restaurant, but for all restaurants, pizzerias, takeaways or any other type of company that produces ready-to-eat food for all their customers. A van with sufficient space inside and with numerous boxes (possibly divided into 3 separate compartments: cold food, food at room temperature, and hot food), could initially pass by the various restaurants, take all the packages of prepared food , load the delivery van, and then go on an optimized journey to make all the deliveries to all the customers of the various restaurants (and this could be done for both breakfasts, lunches and dinners).
		<br /><br />
		In this way, many of those restaurants will be able, having received orders for home deliveries in advance, to have a work phase to arrange ALL the orders requested at home, and then a phase in which ONLY customers are served inside. of the restaurant. This would greatly reduce confusion and overall stress, reduce delivery risks and also increase the range of possible restaurants that can be used for home deliveries.
		<br /><br />
		I can understand that customers, at that point, will not be able to improvise orders at the last moment, but that they will have to plan what they want to eat a certain number of hours in advance (e.g. 5-6 hours in advance) ... but I think that people have to make this effort if they want food delivered a little before the meal.<br />
		<br />
		The only problem could perhaps be given by the fact that pizzerias need to have the oven at high temperatures to cook pizzas, and therefore these two phases (preparation of all the take-away pizzas and preparation of all the pizzas for customers present on site) cannot be divided. This problem, however, is managed and resolved by keeping the collection of takeaway pizzas last compared to the food prepared by all other types of restaurants and takeaways which do not have this need to have the two phases of food preparation (takeaway food first and food for customers on site then) adjacent due to the use of the oven at the right temperature and without significant time intervals between the two phases.<br />
		<br />
		This concerns the logistical part, which however should be the most critical one.<br />
		<br />
		As regards orders and payments, for those I believe that they can be managed via telephone calls or websites of the reference companies, and that payment can be made in the ways established by that company (including any payment on delivery, which in that way it can be easily managed as those who make the deliveries will have a POS and cash box with them to manage it better).
