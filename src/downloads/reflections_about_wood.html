		<h1>Reflections about wood : version 1.0</h1>
		
		As for wood, we know that it is a commonly used material for the creation of furniture and parquet, for example. But in this regard I thought that if you could make a plastic with the workability of wood, there would be several advantages. It would be really great if these &ldquo;plastic planks&rdquo; were also workable by carpenters, as they would not need to change their work tools to work with these innovative materials. First of all, plastic can be of various colors. Second, in the event of floods there is no serious damage to these objects as the plastic itself is waterproof. There would be no problems of aging, termites, moulds. And in addition to this, the life of the trees would be spared. If then these hypothetical plastics were even well recyclable, then it would be really optimal. There would certainly not be major pollution problems as this type of element (furniture and parquet) is destined to remain inside houses for as long as possible.
