	<h2>Ceremonies to carry out (do it yourself) - Version 1.5</h2>
	In this religion, ceremonies have been designed that can be carried out with the following indications.
	<h3>Cerimony in the forest</h3>
Persons participating standing must have reached the age of majority. People must be arranged in alternating genders and each person must look at the butt of the person in front of him. People must stay approximately a couple of meters away from each other. At the moment I suggest these four figures: the circle, the triangle, the square and the X. People can have necklaces with tillandsias, jewelery and bracelets of any kind around their necks (I recommend those with precious metals or minerals). I recommend keeping your arms open and holding in each available hand a potted plant or a sphere of some metal, metallic alloy or mineral, possibly with a whole radius, diameter or circumference of some famous numerical constant in centimeters or other suitable international units of measurement. You can sing songs as you like all together as long as you like them and are fun, singing, whistling or clicking your tongue. I recommend favoring wooded areas, bringing water, fruit/vegetable made beverages to drink with you before the start of the ceremony and urinating calmly in the woods at the end of the ceremony before returning to your homes. You can also perform several different songs but people must not get too tired. Any minors can sit around and participate in a similar way or even by clapping their hands. I suggest planning the songs to be performed before the start of the event so that people can also study them, and in any case taking a break of a few minutes between one song and another... these are the general guidelines ... naturally the more people put effort into performing the songs well, the better the cerimony will be ... those who want to participate should have had a plant based or fruitarian diet since at least 2 months possibly... if during the ceremony those who are standing feel too much energy they can easily lower them by loving the tree in the center or some other visible tree ... I suggest singing a number of songs that is a multiple of 4 where for each group each of the 4 available figures is used. However, transporting potted plants is a delicate operation and we must try to reduce shocks as much as possible.

<h3>Ceremony on the beach</h3>
The beach ceremony involves drawing squares in the sand that correspond to the keys on the computer keyboard (with the same layout), placing a participant in each necessary position. At that point, songs or stories of epic adventures are sung, with the peculiarity that each person can only pronounce the sound in the position of the &ldquo;key&rdquo; it represents. Both adults and children can participate in this, even if they do not necessarily have a plant-based diet (but possibly intend to become one). As with the previous ceremony, it is recommended to drink before the ceremony begins and urinate in a nearby wooded area at the end of the ceremony (if necessary).
