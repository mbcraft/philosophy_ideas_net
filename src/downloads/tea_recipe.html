	Put about 2.5 teacups in a teapot and put it to boil.<br />
	As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat and put an Earl Gray tea bag to infuse.<br />
	The best sachets are the slightly laminated ones because they retain the aroma much better.<br />
	The tea bag should be removed from the water after about 5-10 minutes.<br />
	Squeeze half a lemon (I recommend using high quality lemons, such as Sorrento lemons, which are a bit large and have a thick and wrinkled skin). In addition to this, cut about 6 strips of the peel from the half lemon that you have completely squeezed out with a serrated knife and put them in infusion (generally speaking, a good part of the space in the peel should be used up).<br />
	After about an hour, the tea is ready to be drunk and can be kept outside the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.
