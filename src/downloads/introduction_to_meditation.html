		<h3>My story</h3>
		I started meditating from a very young age, experimenting with the sensations my body offered as I tried to fall asleep. I mostly did meditation alone, sometimes even having a bit bizarre experiences like becoming conscious in the middle of the night and having my body completely paralyzed (terrifying the first few times) but sometimes I also happened to do it together with other people in a group, or even at events with rooms full of people. They are all experiences that I enjoyed and filled me with joy. What I didn't know, however, at the time of him, is that it wouldn't be free. All the happiness I have experienced with meditation and the exercises I have done have served to attain the longed-for goal of &ldquo;nirvana&rdquo; (which is not eternal as commonly thought, but is only a strong momentary happiness together with a feeling completely differently than before) after a series of extremely intense efforts and experiments for about 7 consecutive years. But what I didn't know is that it would cost me dearly. In fact, after reaching it I spent several years of my life in which I ended up in a real psychological meat grinder, which lasted about 4 years. This was perhaps because the happiness I had obtained was only borrowed from my future life, as my feeding at the time of him was not yet ethical enough. In any case, I'm still happy with the path I've chosen, because with meditation I've learned to discipline my mind and improve my sensitivity. What does it feel like when you reach nirvana? It's like when we turn off the computer: the processor and the motherboard stop and there is no more processing. We experience a complete collapse of our way of thinking, a complete mental reorganization (for 1-2 days we can't even squash a word). However, it cost me a lot of effort, time and commitment, I would say perhaps almost like a degree at the conservatory or in engineering. Reaching nirvana only means having the ability to completely shut down one's thoughts and enter a mode of complete observation without any kind of word flowing through one's brain. It has nothing to do with your IQ or your diet. It just means being able to turn off your thoughts on command. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to overcome a very strong psychological obstacle, namely the fear of death.
		<br />
		<br />
		Below I list a few ideas and a few techniques that I consider generally useful.
		<br />
		<br />
		<h3>Focus on concepts</h3>
		This technique is a way to reorganize the mind to be more stable. It can be done when you are immersed in nature, or even at home in front of your cat. It is sufficient to constantly think of a word which can be, for example, 'nature' if one is in the midst of nature, or 'cat' if one is in front of one's cat. This 'mantra' of a single word, linked to the actual experience of that word helps the brain form much better nerve connections as a representation of that word. This improves one's mental organization. It can also be done in front of the refrigerator, repeating 'refrigerator' or in front of a waterfall, repeating 'waterfall'. Any object or concept is fine, as long as it is perfectly consistent with the experience you are having. In fact, what I have noticed is that sometimes using technology but not only the brain gets messed up for a moment and it can sometimes happen that words emerge from the unconscious that are absolutely not consistent with what you are looking at, and this sometimes triggers emotions that we can't quite explain. Let me give you an example: sometimes it happened to me, while observing the handle of a door, to hear the word &ldquo;forearm&rdquo; emerge from my unconscious. This is just one example of &ldquo;clutter&rdquo; that can manifest itself in the mind. With this technique you can put your psyche a little more in order. A few notes on usage: This should be used in well-lit locations unless you are actually thinking of darkness, and should not be used with images or video from electronic devices. In addition to this, I believe that some more physical exercises can also help.

		<h3>Getting out of the comfort zone</h3>
		In general, getting out of your comfort zone is a great way to do mental gymnastics. Even just taking a few nice cold showers every now and then helps...
		<br />
		<h3>Observe people without judging them</h3>
		Another meditation that I experienced was going to a famous Italian city of art, crowded with tourists, and staying in the middle of a square to observe people without interacting. The important concept is to refrain from any form of judgment towards the people you are observing, leaving your mind to pure and simple observation, for as long as you can manage (I tried for about an hour). It has very positive effects.
		<br />
		<h3>Assess the state of your inner fears</h3>
		Fears, anxieties and traumas of various kinds hide in many ways in the brain. There is a way to evaluate how much inner work we have to do to clean up our mind: that of looking at the branches of the trees when it is almost night. If you see something terrifying, know that it is only an effect created by your traumas, fears, pollutions and inner pains.
		<br />
		<h3>An unusual experience</h3>
		If you have the opportunity, try this type of experience: you need a device to listen to music, earphones and some money. Load some metal music on your device, and take it with you along with the earphones to a bar. Order a glass of soy milk with its teaspoon, with one particularity: that of making you put as much foam as possible.
		At this point, sit down, play metal music on your device at a very high volume, put on earphones and start drinking the foam with a spoon. This type of experience is really special, because on one side there is the din of metal music, on the other the foam you are tasting, which is mentally strongly associated with the concept of silence. A better version might even be to use some kind of mat with slightly painful spikes under your butt, because the sensation of pain as opposed to foam is an even more effective contrast.
		<br />
		<h3>Face your fears</h3>
		There is a rather drastic way to face one's fears: that of going to sleep in a forest at night, alone and unarmed. If you want to try this type of experience, I suggest you bring a flashlight, a smartphone, a mattress, and mosquito repellent.
		The best areas are the banks of mountain rivers, where there are rocks large enough in the course of the river to be able to lie down with your mattress. I warn you that it is an extremely adrenalinic experience and that you will hardly be able to sleep. Every single rustling of the fronds or strange noise will make you jump with fear. But know that if you manage to spend a whole night in such a situation, in the morning you will be a completely different person.
		<h3>Play puzzle games or puzzle magazines</h3>
		Playing puzzle games or puzzle magazines I think can be interesting to stimulate the mind. Some puzzle games help to use the mind to solve particular 'imaginary' problems, and I think this can still be a way to keep the mind trained.
		<h3>Listen to birdsong</h3>
		If you live in a country area with enough trees, you will probably be able to hear the song of night birds. I'll leave just one suggestion: when it happens it's typical to have an attitude of irrepressible curiosity towards them. I personally recommend maintaining a psychological attitude of delicacy. It's much better.
		<h3>Making unusual movements</h3>
		In general, problems of various types are hidden in our brain which I will try to list briefly: pain, torpor, old age, boredom, pollution, difficulty and error. Fear is not in the list because it is only a way that the body has to defend its integrity. We are the ones who decide when it's time to take courage and try to overcome our fears. By making unusual movements you can remove some of these problems from your brain. I posted a video on TikTok where I show how to twirl my fingers, but that's just an example. In general, any movement that we are unable to do well or that hides numbness, pain or pollution that has no reason to be there limits our intelligence in some way and blocks a certain type of perceptions and mental resources. Training by doing these types of unusual movements helps improve your intelligence. Slightly casual dances are also fine, the execution of unusual movements in bizarre positions, or even the combination of leg movements (you may need a dangling deckchair hooked to the branches of a tree with a rope and which leaves your movement of the legs while sitting) with movements of the arms or fingers, or shoulders: you have to explore a little with your perceptions.
		<h3>&ldquo;Go hiking&rdquo;</h3>
		&ldquo;Go hiking&rdquo; is important for a particular reason: because then you can urinate near trees. Contrary to what is traditionally taught in certain oriental techniques, the famous &ldquo;kundalini&rdquo; is almost always supplied by the trees in the face of &ldquo;fertilizations&rdquo; received, and this usually happens when you go to bed (but it is at their discretion). It doesn't always happen, but it's none of our business anyway. It's a good habit to try to urinate near trees. Furthermore, this of kundalini is only one of the many rewards that are obtained when the situation of the environment is improved ... there are also others, which are sometimes paid even after some years ...
		<h3>Good nutrition</h3>
		I reached nirvana when I was a vegetarian, but then ended up in hell for several years. I honestly don't recommend it...
		<h3>Other</h3>
		In addition to what I have written, you are still free to try other techniques and to use the contents that I have inserted in the 'philosophy' page and in my TikTok profile, because even in that there are many ideas that could be useful to you. For example, even arranging the bed according to the indications I have provided is certainly an intelligent way to improve one's rest, and it is not something negligible.
